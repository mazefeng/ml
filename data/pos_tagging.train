Shin/N Yonehara/N ,/, a/D research/N scientist/N at/I the/D Tokyo/N Metropolitan/N Institute/N of/I Medical/N Science/N ,/, said/V the/D antibody/N he/P discovered/V works/V by/I recognizing/V an/D antigen/N called/V a/D Fas-antigen/N ,/, which/W is/V characteristic/J of/I an/D infected/J cell/N ./.

Dr./N Yonehara/N and/C his/P partner/N ,/, Nobuyuki/N Kobayashi/N of/I Yamaguchi/N University/N ,/, said/V their/P experiments/N showed/V that/I the/D antibody/N wiped/V out/I an/D average/N of/I 60/C %/N of/I AIDS-infected/J cells/N within/I three/C days/N ./.

A/D #/# 320/C million/C -LRB-/- $/$ 508/C million/C -RRB-/- British/N Airways/N PLC/N rights/N issue/N flopped/V badly/R --/: the/D victim/N of/I recent/J market/N turbulence/N and/C the/D collapse/N of/I the/D buy-out/N bid/N for/I United/N Airlines/N '/P parent/N ,/, UAL/N Corp/N ./.
The/D United/N Kingdom/N carrier/N had/V planned/V the/D issue/N to/T help/V finance/V its/P $/$ 750/C million/C purchase/N of/I a/D 15/C %/N stake/N in/I UAL/N ./.
But/C British/N Airways/N withdrew/V from/I the/D UAL/N labor-management/N buy-out/J plan/N last/J Friday/N ,/, after/I the/D group/N failed/V to/T get/V bank/N financing/N for/I its/P $/$ 6.79/C billion/C buy-out/N ./.
British/N Airways/N said/V its/P shareholders/N accepted/V only/R 6.3/C %/N of/I the/D convertible/J capital/N bonds/N ,/, but/C that/I the/D rest/N of/I the/D issue/N will/M be/V taken/V up/I by/I underwriters/N ./.
Analysts/N said/V that/I 6.3/C %/N level/N marked/V the/D poorest/J showing/N for/I any/D major/J British/J rights/N issue/N since/I the/D 1987/C global/J stock/N market/N crash/N ./.
``/` It/P is/V close/J to/T being/V a/D record/N undersubscription/N ,/, ''/' said/V Bob/N Bucknell/N ,/, an/D analyst/N with/I London/N broker/N Smith/N New/N Court/N Securities/N ./.
``/` Fund/N managers/N do/V n't/R like/V to/T have/V rights/N issues/N that/W do/V n't/R have/V an/D obvious/J reason/N ./.
The/D obvious/J reason/N was/V -LRB-/- for/I British/N Air/N -RRB-/- to/T buy/V a/D stake/N in/I United/N Airlines/N ./. ''/'
In/I a/D statement/N ,/, British/N Air/N Chairman/N Lord/N King/N said/V the/D company/N was/V ``/` obviously/R disappointed/V that/I the/D issue/N was/V not/R taken/V up/I ,/, but/C it/P would/M have/V been/V unreasonable/J to/T expect/V a/D better/J result/N given/V the/D volatility/N of/I the/D stock/N market/N since/I the/D launch/N of/I the/D issue/N ./. ''/'
But/C except/I for/I the/D embarrassment/N ,/, British/N Air/N will/M emerge/V relatively/R unscathed/J from/I the/D flopped/V issue/N ./.
Underwriters/N led/V by/I Lazard/N Brothers/N &/C Co./N will/M pick/V up/I the/D rest/N of/I the/D airline/N 's/P offer/N of/I four/C convertible/J capital/N bonds/N for/I every/D nine/C common/J shares/N ./.

``/` The/D -LRB-/- paper/N -RRB-/- loss/N here/R is/V very/R small/J ''/' for/I these/D sub-underwriters/N ,/, observed/V John/N Nelson/N ,/, a/D Lazard/N managing/V director/N ./.
In/I any/D case/N ,/, he/P added/V ,/, ``/` most/J institutions/N probably/R wo/M n't/R sell/V ''/' the/D bonds/N ./.
And/C instead/R of/I buying/V the/D UAL/N stake/N ,/, the/D U.K./N carrier/N will/M be/V able/J to/T reduce/V its/P high/J debt/N level/N and/C build/V an/D acquisition/N war/N chest/N ./.
``/` From/I a/D cash/N flow/N point/N of/I view/N ,/, British/N Airways/N is/V better/J off/I not/R being/V in/I United/N Airlines/N in/I the/D short/J term/N ,/, ''/' said/V Andy/N Chambers/N ,/, an/D analyst/N at/I Nomura/N Research/N Institute/N in/I London/N ./.

A/D definitive/J agreement/N had/V been/V expected/V by/I the/D end/N of/I July/N ./.
The/D failed/V rights/N issue/N also/R should/M have/V a/D modest/J impact/N on/I British/N Air/N shares/N ./.

In/I late/R trading/N on/I London/N 's/P Stock/N Exchange/N yesterday/N ,/, the/D shares/N were/V off/I three/C pence/N at/I 194/C pence/N ./.
And/C because/I British/N Air/N is/V issuing/V convertible/J bonds/N rather/R than/I ordinary/J shares/N ,/, the/D share/N price/N wo/M n't/R be/V directly/R hurt/V by/I any/D surplus/N left/V with/I underwriters/N after/I they/P try/V to/T sell/V the/D issue/N in/I the/D open/J market/N ./.
But/C British/N Air/N 's/P withdrawal/N from/I the/D UAL/N buy-out/N could/M have/V further/J repercussions/N ./.
Some/D analysts/N speculated/V yesterday/N that/I the/D move/N has/V set/V off/I a/D board/N room/N split/N ,/, which/W may/M lead/V to/T the/D resignation/N of/I Sir/N Colin/N Marshall/N ,/, the/D carrier/N 's/P chief/N executive/N officer/N ./.

The/D article/N is/V ,/, unfortunately/R ,/, replete/J with/I outrageous/J distortions/N ./.
One/C of/I Mr./N Roberts/N 's/P observations/N is/V that/I the/D Bank/N 's/P own/J loan/N portfolio/N is/V in/I deep/J trouble/N because/I of/I its/P lending/N to/T developing/V countries/N ./.
This/D is/V just/R not/R so/R ./.
The/D reality/N is/V that/I Bank/N finances/N are/V rock/N solid/J ./.
As/I of/I June/N 30/C ,/, 1989/C --/: the/D day/N our/P past/N fiscal/J year/N came/V to/T a/D close/N --/: only/R 4.1/C %/N of/I the/D Bank/N 's/P portfolio/N was/V affected/V by/I arrears/N of/I over/I six/C months/N ./.
This/D is/V an/D enviably/R low/J level/N ./.
Moreover/R ,/, the/D Bank/N follows/V a/D prudent/J provisioning/V policy/N and/C has/V set/V aside/R $/$ 800/C million/C against/I possible/J loan/N losses/N ./.
For/I the/D same/J fiscal/J year/N ,/, by/I the/D way/N ,/, the/D Bank/N 's/P net/J income/N was/V a/D robust/J $/$ 1.1/C billion/C after/I provisions/N ./.
Because/I of/I the/D business-like/J manner/N in/I which/W the/D Bank/N goes/V about/I development/N ,/, financial/J markets/N have/V confidence/N in/I it/P ./.
This/D helps/V explain/V the/D triple-A/J rating/N enjoyed/V by/I our/P bonds/N and/C our/P ability/N to/T borrow/V $/$ 9.3/C billion/C in/I fiscal/J 1989/C on/I the/D most/R advantageous/J terms/N ./.
Another/D of/I Mr./N Roberts/N 's/P criticisms/N is/V that/D Bank/N lending/N has/V done/V more/J harm/N than/I good/J ``/` by/I implanting/V the/D wrong/J incentives/N and/C deflecting/V energy/N away/R from/I economic/J development/N ./. ''/'
Here/R ,/, too/R ,/, Mr./N Roberts/N is/V way/N off/I the/D mark/N ./.
The/D reality/N is/V that/I Bank/N loans/N have/V been/V linked/V to/T policy/N improvements/N for/I 40/C years/N ./.
Our/P traditional/J project/N loans/N have/V ,/, for/I instance/N ,/, supported/V sensible/J energy/N pricing/N in/I the/D power/N sector/N ,/, sound/J interest-rate/J policies/N in/I the/D credit/N area/N and/C the/D operation/N of/I public/J utilities/N as/I efficient/J ,/, autonomous/J agencies/N ./.
By/I and/C large/J ,/, these/D efforts/N have/V borne/V fruit/N ./.
In/I my/P home/N region/N ,/, Latin/N America/N ,/, much/R of/I the/D existing/V infrastructure/N base/N --/: an/D important/J building/N block/N for/I development/N --/: has/V been/V financed/V by/I the/D World/N Bank/N ./.
Mr./N Roberts/N also/R takes/V a/D swipe/N at/I the/D Bank/N 's/P adjustment/N lending/N ./.

The/D Bank/N has/V been/V making/V adjustment/N loans/N for/I 10/C years/N ./.
As/I their/P name/N implies/V ,/, these/D operations/N are/V linked/V to/T far-reaching/J policy/N reforms/N that/W aim/V at/I helping/V borrowing/N countries/N get/V back/R on/I the/D growth/N path/N and/C at/I enhancing/V their/P credit-worthiness/N ./.
Typically/R ,/, these/D measures/N include/V reforms/N to/T downsize/V the/D role/N of/I government/N and/C parastatals/N in/I the/D economy/N ,/, to/T open/V up/I inward-looking/J economies/N to/T international/J competition/N and/C to/T promote/V the/D development/N of/I a/D vigorous/J private/J sector/N ./.
Support/N for/I the/D private/J sector/N has/V been/V a/D longstanding/J concern/N of/I the/D Bank/N 's/P ./.
Over/I the/D years/N ,/, it/P has/V helped/V encourage/V investments/N by/I entrepreneurs/N in/I the/D Third/N World/N through/I its/P extensive/J credit/N operations/N and/C through/I loans/N and/C investments/N by/I the/D International/N Finance/N Corp/N ./.
Most/R recently/R ,/, the/D Bank/N Group/N has/V been/V expanded/V to/T include/V the/D Multilateral/N Investment/N Guarantee/N Agency/N to/T stimulate/V direct/J foreign/J investment/N in/I developing/V countries/N by/I offering/V guarantees/N against/I noncommercial/J risk/N and/C advice/N to/T member/N countries/N on/I how/W to/T improve/V their/P business/N climate/N ./.

The/D resignations/N by/I the/D two/C executives/N ,/, considered/V hard-charging/N and/C abrasive/N by/I Reebok/N insiders/N ,/, reflect/V a/D difference/N in/I style/N with/I Paul/N Fireman/N ,/, chairman/N and/C chief/N executive/N ,/, according/V to/T several/J former/J executives/N ./.

It/P 's/V easy/J to/T get/V something/N comparable/J by/I simply/R moving/V to/T a/D higher/J altitude/N in/I the/D U.S/N ./.
Moreover/R ,/, there/E are/V questions/N ,/, particularly/R among/I atmospheric/J scientists/N who/W know/V this/D subject/N best/R ,/, about/I the/D ability/N of/I anyone/N to/T know/V what/W in/I fact/N is/V happening/V to/T the/D ozone/N layer/N ./.
It/P is/V generally/R agreed/V that/I when/W CFCs/N rise/N from/I earth/N to/T stratosphere/N ,/, the/D chlorine/N in/I them/P is/V capable/J of/I interfering/V with/I the/D process/N through/I which/W ultraviolet/N rays/N split/V oxygen/N molecules/N and/C form/N ozone/N ./.
But/C ozone/N creation/N is/V a/D very/R large-scale/J natural/J process/N and/C the/D importance/N of/I human-generated/J CFCs/N in/I reducing/V it/P is/V largely/R a/D matter/N of/I conjecture/N ./.
The/D ozone/N layer/N is/V constantly/R in/I motion/N and/C thus/R very/R hard/J to/T measure/V ./.
What/W scientists/N have/V known/V since/I the/D late/J 1970s/C is/V that/I there/E is/V a/D hole/N in/I the/D layer/N over/I Antarctica/N that/W expands/V or/C contracts/V from/I year/N to/T year/N ./.
But/C it/P is/V at/I least/J worthy/J of/I some/D note/N that/I there/E are/V very/R few/J refrigerators/N in/I Antarctica/N ./.
Moreover/R ,/, surely/R someone/N has/V noticed/V that/I household/N refrigerators/N are/V closed/V systems/N ,/, running/V for/I many/J years/N without/I either/C the/D CFC/N gas/N or/C the/D insulation/N ever/R escaping/V ./.
Another/D argument/N of/I the/D environmentalists/N is/V that/I if/I substitutes/N are/V available/J ,/, why/W not/R use/V them/P ?/.
Mr./N Teagan/N cites/V a/D list/N of/I substitutes/N but/C none/N ,/, so/R far/R ,/, match/V the/D nonflammable/J ,/, nontoxic/J CFCs/N ./.
Butane/N and/C propane/N can/M be/V used/V as/I coolants/N ,/, for/I example/N ,/, but/C are/V flammable/J ./.
Moreover/R ,/, new/J lubricants/N will/M be/V needed/V to/T protect/V compressors/N from/I the/D new/J formulations/N ,/, which/W ,/, as/I with/I CFCs/N ,/, are/V solvents/N ./.
Mr./N Teagan/N points/V out/I as/R well/R that/I if/I the/D equipment/N designed/V to/T get/V along/I without/I CFCs/N is/V less/R efficient/J than/I current/J devices/N ,/, energy/N consumption/N will/M rise/V and/C that/W will/M worsen/V the/D greenhouse/N effect/N ./.
Folks/N in/I the/D Midwest/N who/W just/R suffered/V a/D mid-October/J snowstorm/N may/M wonder/V where/W the/D greenhouse/N was/V when/W they/P needed/V it/P ,/, but/C let/V 's/P not/R be/V flippant/J about/I grave/J risks/N ./.
As/I it/P happens/V ,/, Arthur/N D./N Little/N is/V not/R at/I all/D interested/V in/I throwing/V cold/J water/N on/I ozone/N depletion/N and/C global/J warming/N theories/N ./.

They/P needed/V new/J crises/N to/T generate/V new/J grants/N and/C contracts/N ./.
In/I other/J words/N ,/, environmentalism/N has/V created/V a/D whole/J set/N of/I vested/V interests/N that/W fare/V better/R when/W there/E are/V many/J problems/N than/I when/W there/E are/V few/J ./.

Garry/N Kasparov/N went/V to/T combat/V Sunday/N with/I the/D world/N 's/P most/R advanced/V chess/N computer/N and/C kicked/V it/P around/I --/: symbolically/R ,/, anyway/R --/: like/I an/D old/J tin/N can/N ./.
Playing/V black/J in/I the/D first/J game/N ,/, the/D human/J champion/N maneuvered/V Deep/N Thought/N ,/, known/V for/I its/P attacking/V prowess/N ,/, into/I a/D totally/R passive/J position/N ./.

Though/I almost/R everybody/N at/I the/D playing/V site/N had/V been/V looking/V for/I the/D 26-year-old/J Soviet/N to/T beat/V the/D Pennsylvania-based/J computer/N ,/, he/P gave/V the/D machine/N a/D far/R worse/J drubbing/N than/I many/J expected/V ./.
And/C when/W Mr./N Kasparov/N strode/V into/I the/D playing/V hall/N ,/, he/P called/V the/D outcome/N ./.
As/I if/I he/P were/V Iron/N Mike/N ,/, about/I to/T enter/V the/D ring/N with/I a/D 98-pound/J weakling/N ,/, he/P declared/V :/: ``/` I/P 'll/M be/V able/J to/T beat/V any/D computer/N for/I the/D next/J five/C years/N ./. ''/'
His/P strategy/N against/I D.T./N was/V based/V on/I a/D thorough/J study/N of/I dozens/N of/I its/P games/N ,/, he/P said/V ,/, including/V its/P notorious/J whippings/N of/I the/D grandmasters/N Bent/N Larsen/N of/I Denmark/N and/C Robert/N Byrne/N of/I the/D U.S./N Mr./N Kasparov/N was/V underwhelmed/V ./.
``/` The/D computer/N 's/P mind/N is/V too/R straight/J ,/, too/R primitive/J ,/, ''/' lacking/V the/D intuition/N and/C creativity/N needed/V to/T reach/V the/D top/N ,/, he/P said/V ./.
The/D champion/N apparently/R was/V not/R worried/V at/I all/D about/I D.T./N 's/P strong/J points/N ./.
Its/P chief/N builder/N ,/, Taiwan-born/J Feng-hsiung/N Hsu/N ,/, nicknamed/V his/P brainchild/N ``/` the/D Weasel/N ''/' for/I its/P tactical/J flair/N at/I wriggling/V out/I of/I horrible/J positions/N ./.
D.T./N also/R has/V a/D prodigious/J and/C flawless/J memory/N ,/, is/V utterly/R fearless/J ,/, and/C could/M n't/R be/V distracted/V by/I the/D sexy/J nude/J sculptures/N spread/V around/I the/D playing/N hall/N ,/, in/I the/D New/N York/N Academy/N of/I Art/N ./.
In/I fact/N ,/, D.T./N never/R left/V home/N ,/, Carnegie/N Mellon/N University/N in/I Pittsburgh/N ,/, but/C communicated/V with/I its/P human/J handlers/N by/I telephone/N link/N ./.
They/P conceded/V that/I the/D odds/N favored/V Mr./N Kasparov/N ,/, but/C they/P put/V their/P hope/N in/I D.T./N 's/P recently/R enhanced/V capacity/N for/I examining/V positions/N --/: up/I to/T a/D million/C per/I second/J ,/, from/I 720,000/C ./.
But/C the/D handlers/N mistakenly/R stuck/V with/I silicon/N chips/N ;/: they/P needed/V kryptonite/N ./.
This/D became/V apparent/J as/I game/N one/C ,/, a/D Sicilian/N Defense/N by/I Mr./N Kasparov/N ,/, proceeded/V ./.
No/D human/N can/M examine/V millions/N of/I moves/N ,/, but/C Mr./N Kasparov/N ,/, using/V his/P ineffably/R powerful/J brain/N ,/, consistently/R found/V very/R good/J ones/N ./.
After/I eight/C moves/N by/I each/D side/N ,/, the/D board/N was/V the/D same/J as/I in/I a/D game/N in/I which/W Nigel/N Short/N of/I Great/N Britain/N fought/V the/D champion/N to/T a/D draw/N in/I 1980/C ./.
But/C the/D computer/N did/V n't/R play/V Mr./N Short/N 's/P ninth/J move/N ,/, a/D key/J pawn/N thrust/N ,/, and/C its/P position/N deteriorated/V rapidly/R ./.
Instead/R of/I castling/V ,/, a/D standard/J measure/N to/T safeguard/V the/D king/N ,/, D.T./N made/V a/D second-rate/J rook/N maneuver/N at/I move/N 13/C ;/: then/R it/P put/V a/D knight/N offside/N on/I move/N 16/C ./.
``/` Only/R two/C classes/N of/I minds/N would/M think/V of/I this/D --/: very/R weak/J human/J players/N ,/, and/C computers/N ,/, ''/' said/V Edmar/N Mednis/N ,/, the/D expert/J commentator/N for/I the/D match/N ,/, which/W was/V attended/V by/I hundreds/N of/I chess/N fans/N ./.
By/I move/N 21/C ,/, D.T./N had/V fallen/V into/I a/D deep/J positional/J trap/N ./.
It/P allowed/V Mr./N Kasparov/N to/T exchange/V his/P dark-squared/J bishop/N for/I one/C of/I D.T./N 's/P knights/N ./.
Bishops/N usually/R are/V worth/J slightly/R more/J than/I knights/N ,/, but/C in/I this/D case/N Mr./N Kasparov/N was/V left/V with/I a/D very/R dangerous/J knight/N and/C D.T./N 's/P surviving/V bishop/N was/V reduced/V to/T passivity/N ./.
Indeed/R ,/, it/P looked/V more/J like/I a/D pawn/N ,/, a/D ``/` tall/J pawn/N ,/, ''/' as/I spectators/N snidely/R put/V it/P ./.
Consistently/R ,/, D.T./N was/V over-optimistic/J about/I its/P chances/N ,/, which/W it/P continually/R sized/V up/I ,/, in/I numerical/J form/N ./.
When/W most/J spectators/N thought/V its/P position/N hopeless/J ,/, the/D computer/N thought/V it/P was/V only/R ,/, in/I effect/N ,/, one-half/N of/I a/D pawn/N down/I ./.
Such/J evaluations/N met/V with/I derision/N ,/, and/C kept/V the/D machine/N from/I resigning/V as/R soon/R as/I humans/N would/M have/V --/: prompting/V more/J derision/N ./.
While/I D.T./N shuffled/V its/P king/N back/R and/C forth/R in/I a/D defensive/J crouch/N ,/, Mr./N Kasparov/N maneuvered/V the/D knight/N to/T a/D dominant/J outpost/N ./.
He/P also/R launched/V a/D kingside/N storm/N ,/, sacrificing/V a/D pawn/N to/T denude/V D.T./N 's/P king/N ./.
No/D amount/N of/I weasling/V could/M have/V saved/V this/D game/N for/I D.T./N
A/D piece/N down/I ,/, the/D computer/N resigned/V ./.
Now/R ,/, with/I the/D crowd/N in/I the/D analysis/N room/N smelling/V figurative/J blood/N ,/, the/D only/J question/N seemed/V to/T be/V how/W fast/J Mr./N Kasparov/N could/M win/V game/N two/C ./.
With/I the/D advantage/N of/I playing/V white/J -LRB-/- which/W moves/V first/J -RRB-/- ,/, Mr./N Kasparov/N followed/V up/I cleverly/R against/I the/D computer/N 's/P defense/N ,/, a/D Queen/N 's/P Gambit/N Accepted/N ./.
As/R early/R as/I move/N six/C ,/, Mr./N Kasparov/N deviated/V from/I a/D well-known/J sequence/N of/I moves/N ,/, developing/V a/D knight/N instead/R of/I making/V a/D standard/J bishop/N attack/N against/I the/D computer/N 's/P advanced/V knight/N ./.
This/D left/V the/D computer/N with/I a/D broader/J range/N of/I plausible/J replies/N --/: and/C it/P immediately/R blundered/V by/I moving/V a/D queenside/N pawn/N ,/, to/T the/D neglect/N of/I kingside/N development/N ./.
``/` In/I a/D new/J position/N just/R after/I the/D opening/N ,/, a/D computer/N will/M have/V serious/J problems/N ,/, ''/' Mr./N Kasparov/N said/V later/R ./.
In/I such/J positions/N ,/, he/P explained/V ,/, ``/` you/P have/V to/T create/V something/N new/J ,/, and/C the/D computer/N is/V n't/R able/J to/T do/V that/D right/R now/R ./. ''/'
After/I only/R 11/C moves/N for/I each/D side/N ,/, the/D computer/N 's/P position/N was/V shaky/J ./.
Greedily/R ,/, it/P grabbed/V a/D pawn/N ,/, at/I the/D cost/N of/I facing/V a/D brutal/J attack/N ./.
And/C when/W a/D defensive/J move/N was/V called/V for/I ,/, D.T./N passed/V up/I an/D obvious/J pawn/N move/N and/C instead/R exposed/V its/P queen/N to/T immediate/J tactical/J threats/N ./.
Mr./N Kasparov/N remarked/V later/R that/I ``/` even/R a/D weak/J club/N player/N ''/' would/M have/V avoided/V the/D queen/N move/N ./.
Now/R ,/, after/I only/R a/D dozen/N moves/N ,/, spectators/N were/V looking/V for/I a/D mating/N combination/N ./.
On/I a/D demonstration/N board/N ,/, emcee/N Shelby/N Lyman/N showed/V a/D quick/J kill/N initiated/V by/I a/D knight/N sacrifice/N ;/: no/D spectator/N refuted/V this/D line/N of/I play/N ./.
Mr./N Kasparov/N 's/P continuation/N was/V slower/J but/C ,/, in/I the/D end/N ,/, just/R as/I deadly/J ./.
He/P won/V D.T./N 's/P queen/N for/I two/C minor/J pieces/N and/C two/C pawns/N --/: not/R enough/R compensation/N ,/, in/I this/D position/N ,/, to/T give/V the/D computer/N much/J hope/N ./.
In/I a/D hopeless/J position/N ,/, the/D computer/N resigned/V rather/R than/I make/V its/P 37th/J move/N ./.
And/C Mr./N Kasparov/N ,/, to/T cheers/N and/C applause/N ,/, marched/V back/R into/I the/D analysis/N room/N ./.
``/` In/I both/D games/N I/P got/V exactly/R what/W I/P wanted/V ,/, ''/' he/P said/V ./.
What/W he/P had/V demonstrated/V ,/, he/P added/V ,/, is/V that/I there/E 's/V more/J to/T chess/N than/I sheer/J calculation/N ./.

Reaching/V for/I that/D extra/J bit/N of/I yield/N can/M be/V a/D big/J mistake/N --/: especially/R if/I you/P do/V n't/R understand/V what/W you/P 're/V investing/V in/I ./.
Just/R ask/V Richard/N Blumenfeld/N ,/, a/D New/N Jersey/N dentist/N who/W considers/V himself/P ``/` a/D reasonably/R sophisticated/J investor/N ./. ''/'
In/I May/N 1986/C ,/, Dr./N Blumenfeld/N gave/V Merrill/N Lynch/N &/C Co./N about/I $/$ 40,000/C for/I a/D federally/R insured/V certificate/N of/I deposit/N offering/V an/D effective/J yield/N of/I more/R than/I 9/C %/N ./.
``/` It/P was/V a/D time/N when/W interest/N rates/N came/V down/I very/R rapidly/R ,/, ''/' Dr./N Blumenfeld/N recalls/V ./.
Yields/N on/I five-year/J CDs/N at/I major/J banks/N were/V averaging/V about/I 7.45/C %/N ,/, and/C 10-year/J Treasury/N notes/N were/V paying/V less/R than/I 8/C %/N ./.
The/D CD/N seemed/V like/I a/D great/J deal/N ./.
But/C nearly/R 3/C years/N later/R ,/, Merrill/N says/V the/D investment/N is/V worth/J about/I $/$ 43,000/C --/: an/D amount/N that/W represents/V an/D annual/J return/N of/I just/R over/I 2/C %/N on/I Dr./N Blumenfeld/N 's/P $/$ 40,000/C ./.
The/D problem/N is/V that/I the/D CD/N he/P bought/V for/I a/D retirement/N plan/N was/V n't/R a/D plain/J vanilla/N CD/N ./.
Instead/R ,/, his/P Merrill/N broker/N put/V him/P in/I a/D zero-coupon/J CD/N ,/, which/W is/V sold/V at/I a/D deep/J discount/N to/T its/P face/N value/N ./.
The/D difference/N between/I the/D price/N and/C the/D face/N value/N payable/J at/I maturity/N is/V the/D investor/N 's/P return/N ./.
More/R important/J ,/, the/D CD/N was/V purchased/V on/I the/D secondary/J ,/, or/C resale/N ,/, market/N ./.
Because/I the/D CD/N had/V an/D effective/J yield/N of/I 13.4/C %/N when/W it/P was/V issued/V in/I 1984/C ,/, and/C interest/N rates/N in/I general/J had/V declined/V sharply/R since/I then/R ,/, part/N of/I the/D price/N Dr./N Blumenfeld/N paid/V was/V a/D premium/N --/: an/D additional/J amount/N on/I top/N of/I the/D CD/N 's/P base/N value/N plus/C accrued/V interest/N that/W represented/V the/D CD/N 's/P increased/V market/N value/N ./.
Now/R the/D thrift/N that/W issued/V the/D CD/N is/V insolvent/J ,/, and/C Dr./N Blumenfeld/N has/V learned/V to/T his/P surprise/N that/I the/D premium/N is/V n't/R insured/V under/I federal/J deposit/N insurance/N ./.
The/D tip-off/N came/V when/W he/P opened/V a/D recent/J Merrill/N Lynch/N statement/N and/C found/V that/I the/D CD/N 's/P ``/` estimated/V current/J market/N value/N ''/' had/V plummeted/V by/I $/$ 9,000/C in/I a/D month/N ./.
Several/J phone/N calls/N and/C a/D visit/N to/T his/P broker/N 's/P office/N later/R ,/, the/D dentist/N found/V out/I that/I the/D $/$ 9,000/C drop/N represented/V the/D current/J value/N of/I the/D premium/N he/P paid/V when/W he/P bought/V the/D CD/N ,/, and/C that/I the/D amount/N was/V n't/R insured/V ./.
``/` This/D is/V one/C thing/N I/P was/V never/R aware/J of/I ,/, ''/' he/P says/V ./.

The/D quarter/N net/N was/V below/I analyst/N expectations/N mainly/R because/I truck-parts/N sales/N did/V n't/R rebound/V in/I September/N from/I the/D summer/N doldrums/N as/I they/P usually/R do/V ,/, said/V Patrick/N E./N Sheridan/N ,/, analyst/N with/I McDonald/N &/C Co/N ./.

Mr./N Hardis/N said/V truck-fleet/J operators/N appear/V to/T be/V cautious/J about/I buying/V new/J trucks/N until/I they/P see/V how/W the/D economy/N behaves/V ./.
The/D truck/N sales/N slowdown/N reflects/V the/D general/J slowing/N in/I sales/N of/I consumer/N goods/N ,/, he/P said/V ,/, and/C the/D latest/J reports/N show/V a/D slight/J improvement/N rather/R than/I any/D indication/N of/I a/D downward/J spiral/N ./.

In/I Poland/N 's/P rapid/J shift/N from/I socialism/N to/T an/D undefined/J alternative/N ,/, environmental/J issues/N have/V become/V a/D cutting/V edge/N of/I broader/J movements/N to/T restructure/N the/D economy/N ,/, cut/V cumbersome/J bureaucracies/N ,/, and/C democratize/V local/J politics/N ./.
Initial/J steps/N were/V taken/V at/I Poland/N 's/P first/J international/J environmental/J conference/N ,/, which/W I/P attended/V last/J month/N ./.
The/D conference/N ,/, held/V in/I Lower/N Silesia/N ,/, was/V co-sponsored/J by/I the/D Environment/N Ministry/N ,/, the/D Rockefeller/N Brothers/N Fund/N ,/, and/C the/D Polish/N Ecological/N Club/N ,/, and/C was/V attended/V by/I 50/C Poles/N from/I government/N and/C industry/N ,/, as/R well/R as/I Hungarians/N ,/, Czechs/N ,/, Russians/N ,/, Japanese/N and/C Americans/N ./.
The/D conference/N was/V entitled/V ``/` Economic/N Mechanisms/N for/I Environmental/N Protection/N ,/, ''/' a/D significant/J departure/N from/I East/N Bloc/N usage/N ,/, which/W recognizes/V only/R one/C economic/J mechanism/N --/: central/J planning/N --/: to/T direct/V industrial/J behavior/N ./.
Even/R more/R remarkably/R ,/, it/P focused/V on/I emissions/N trading/N and/C similar/J market/N approaches/V to/T address/V pollution/N ,/, notwithstanding/I Poland/N 's/P lack/N of/I functioning/V markets/N ./.
Why/W did/V East/N Bloc/N participants/N unanimously/R endorse/V market-based/J pollution/N approaches/N ?/.
The/D answer/N lies/V both/D in/I the/D degraded/J environment/N of/I these/D countries/N and/C the/D perceived/V causes/N of/I that/D degradation/N ./.
Like/I other/J East/N Bloc/N countries/N ,/, Poland/N possesses/V environmental/J laws/N more/R honored/V in/I their/P breach/N than/I in/I their/P observance/N ./.
According/V to/T a/D detailed/V report/N by/I Zbigniew/N Bochniarz/N of/I the/D University/N of/I Minnesota/N 's/P Hubert/N Humphrey/N Institute/N ,/, 27/C areas/N containing/V a/D third/J of/I Poland/N 's/P population/N are/V regarded/V as/I ``/` ecological/J hazards/N ''/' due/J to/T multiple/J violations/N of/I standards/N ./.
Norms/N are/V consistently/R exceeded/V at/I 60/C %/N of/I nitrogen/N oxide/N monitoring/V sites/N and/C 80/C %/N of/I those/D for/I dust/N and/C soot/N emissions/N ./.
Four-fifths/N of/I Poland/N 's/P soils/N have/V become/V highly/R acidified/V ;/: 70/C %/N of/I its/P southern/J forests/N are/V projected/V to/T die/V by/I century/N 's/P end/N ./.
Between/I 1965/C and/C 1985/C ,/, Polish/N waters/N fit/V for/I human/J consumption/N dropped/V from/I 33/C %/N to/T 6/C %/N of/I all/D surface/N waters/N ,/, while/I those/D unfit/J even/R for/I industry/N use/N nearly/R doubled/V ./.
Poland/N produces/V about/I 20/C times/N more/J soot/N and/C five/C times/N more/R sulfur/N dioxide/N and/C solid/J waste/N per/I unit/N of/I gross/J national/J product/N than/I does/V Western/N Europe/N ./.
Its/P mortality/N rate/N for/I males/N over/I 35/C is/V about/I 50/C %/N higher/J than/I West/N Germany/N 's/P ,/, and/C 50/C %/N higher/J in/I hazard/N areas/N than/I the/D national/J average/N ./.
Since/I 1978/C ,/, average/J annual/J growth/N rates/N for/I most/J pollutants/N have/V outstripped/V the/D growth/N of/I GNP/N ./.
Conference/N participants/N saw/V these/D effects/N as/I flowing/V directly/R from/I -LRB-/- a/D -RRB-/- Marxist/J devaluation/N of/I environmental/J resources/N ,/, which/W are/V not/R produced/V by/I labor/N ;/: -LRB-/- b/N -RRB-/- planned/V economies/N '/P inability/N to/T control/V pollution/N where/W enterprises/N are/V state-owned/J and/C penalties/N are/V paid/V by/I the/D government/N ;/: and/C -LRB-/- c/N -RRB-/- the/D continuing/V Stalinist/J emphasis/N on/I heavy/J industry/N for/I economic/J development/N ,/, producing/V a/D far/R heavier/J and/C more/R wasteful/J use/N of/I energy/N and/C natural/J resources/N than/I in/I the/D West/N ./.
They/P repeatedly/R noted/V that/D environmental/J progress/N could/M not/R be/V secured/V without/I true/J ownership/N ,/, genuine/J competition/N based/V on/I market/N factors/N ,/, and/C the/D risk/N of/I bankruptcy/N if/I a/D business/N makes/V the/D wrong/J decisions/N ./.
The/D solutions/N they/P formally/R proposed/V included/V taxes/N ,/, conservation/N and/C recycling/V incentives/N ,/, reforestation/N offsets/N ,/, transferable/J pollution/N permits/V ,/, an/D ecological/J bank/N to/T finance/V pollution-reduction/N credits/N ,/, and/C debt-for-environment/N swaps/N ./.
But/C their/P most/J fundamental/J recommendation/N was/V to/T separate/V industry/N from/I the/D state/N ,/, making/V it/P fully/R accountable/J for/I pollution/N control/N ./.
A/D revolution/N takes/V more/R than/I conference/N manifestos/N ./.
Indeed/R ,/, skepticism/N was/V amply/R captured/V by/I a/D joke/N told/V by/I Poles/N at/I the/D conference/N :/: ``/` The/D world/N must/M be/V coming/V to/T an/D end/N ./.

And/C the/D Poles/N are/V engaged/V in/I commerce/N ./. ''/'
But/C the/D implications/N of/I such/P a/D shift/N to/T market/N approaches/N go/V well/R beyond/I the/D fact/N that/I Poland/N is/V already/R working/V on/I nationwide/J emissions/N trades/N to/T reduce/V smelter/N pollution/N ,/, or/C that/I the/D Soviets/N plan/N to/T introduce/V marketable/J pollution/N permits/N in/I some/D republics/N next/I year/N ./.
Those/D implications/N include/V :/: --/: Privatization/N
Faced/V with/I a/D $/$ 40/C billion/C foreign/J debt/N and/C skyrocketing/V inflation/N ,/, Poland/N must/M privatize/V industry/N and/C eliminate/V subsidies/N to/T stabilize/V its/P currency/N and/C qualify/V for/I international/J assistance/N ./.
Market-based/J pollution/N control/N may/M consume/V some/D capital/N that/W would/M otherwise/R purchase/V state/N industries/N ./.
But/C it/P could/M also/R accelerate/V ``/` marketization/N ''/' by/I reinforcing/V industrial/J accountability/N ,/, breaking/V up/I state/N monopolies/N ,/, giving/V managers/N a/D stake/N in/I solutions/N ,/, and/C ensuring/V that/D modernization/N is/V not/R reversible/J for/I failure/N to/T address/V environmental/J effects/N ./.
--/: Least-cost/J solutions/N ./.
As/I conferees/N noted/V ,/, scarce/J capital/N means/V the/D costs/N of/I control/N must/M be/V minimized/V through/I a/D broad/J menu/N of/I compliance/N choices/N for/I individual/J firms/N ./.
That/D means/V simple/J ,/, clear/J rules/N that/W secure/V the/D first/J large/J blocks/N of/I reduction/N ,/, deferring/V more/J complex/J issues/N such/J as/I risk/N ./.
It/P also/R means/V use/N of/I quantity-based/J pollution/N limits/N such/J as/I transferable/J permits/N ,/, rather/R than/I price-based/J limits/N such/J as/I effluent/J fees/N ./.
That/D 's/V because/I quota-trained/J managers/N will/M likely/R respond/V better/R to/T quantity/N than/I to/T price/N signals/N ./.
--/: Creative/J financing/N ./.
Even/R least-cost/J environmental/J solutions/N will/M require/V billions/N of/I dollars/N ./.

East/N Bloc/N pollution/N data/N typically/R have/V been/V state/N secrets/N ./.
While/I Polish/N data/N have/V been/V freely/R available/J since/I 1980/C ,/, it/P was/V no/D accident/N that/I participants/N urged/V the/D free/J flow/N of/I information/N ./.

His/P point/N :/: It/P will/M be/V increasingly/R difficult/J for/I the/D U.S./N to/T cling/V to/T command-and-control/J measures/N if/I even/R the/D East/N Bloc/N steps/V to/T a/D different/J drummer/N ./.
At/I the/D moment/N ,/, Poland/N resembles/V 19th-century/J Pittsburgh/N more/J than/I a/D modern/J industrial/J society/N --/: with/I antiquated/J production/N ,/, inadequate/J environmental/J management/N ,/, and/C little/R ecological/J awareness/N ./.

Why/W ca/M n't/R we/P teach/V our/P children/N to/T read/V ,/, write/V and/C reckon/V ?/.
It/P 's/V not/R that/I we/P do/V n't/R know/V how/W to/T ,/, because/I we/P do/V ./.
It/P 's/V that/I we/P do/V n't/R want/V to/T ./.
And/C the/D reason/N we/P do/V n't/R want/V to/T is/V that/I effective/J education/N would/M require/V us/P to/T relinquish/V some/D cherished/V metaphysical/J beliefs/N about/I human/J nature/N in/I general/J and/C the/D human/J nature/N of/I young/J people/N in/I particular/J ,/, as/R well/R as/I to/T violate/V some/D cherished/V vested/V interests/N ./.
These/D beliefs/N so/R dominate/V our/P educational/J establishment/N ,/, our/P media/N ,/, our/P politicians/N ,/, and/C even/R our/P parents/N that/I it/P seems/V almost/R blasphemous/J to/T challenge/V them/P ./.
Here/R is/V an/D example/N ./.
If/I I/P were/V to/T ask/V a/D sample/N of/I American/J parents/N ,/, ``/` Do/V you/P wish/V the/D elementary/J schools/N to/T encourage/V creativity/N in/I your/P children/N ?/. ''/' the/D near-unanimous/J answer/N would/M be/V ,/, ``/` Yes/U ,/, of/I course/N ./. ''/'
But/C what/W do/V we/P mean/V ,/, specifically/R ,/, by/I ``/` creativity/N ''/' ?/.
No/D one/N can/M say/V ./.
In/I practice/N ,/, it/P ends/V up/I being/V equated/V with/I a/D ``/` self-expression/N ''/' that/W encourages/V the/D youngsters/N '/P ``/` self-esteem/N ./. ''/'
The/D result/N is/V a/D generation/N of/I young/J people/N whose/W ignorance/N and/C intellectual/J incompetence/N is/V matched/V only/R by/I their/P good/J opinion/N of/I themselves/P ./.
The/D whole/J notion/N of/I ``/` creativity/N ''/' in/I education/N was/V -LRB-/- and/C is/V -RRB-/- part/N and/C parcel/N of/I a/D romantic/J rebellion/N against/I disciplined/V instruction/N ,/, which/W was/V -LRB-/- and/C is/V -RRB-/- regarded/V as/I ``/` authoritarian/J ,/, ''/' a/D repression/N and/C frustration/N of/I the/D latent/N talents/N and/C the/D wonderful/J ,/, if/I as/R yet/R undefined/J ,/, potentialities/N inherent/J in/I the/D souls/N of/I all/P our/P children/N ./.
It/P is/V not/R surprising/J that/I parents/N find/V this/D romantic/J extravagance/N so/R attractive/J ./.
Fortunately/R ,/, these/D same/J parents/N do/V want/V their/P children/N to/T get/V a/D decent/J education/N as/R traditionally/R understood/V ,/, and/C they/P have/V enough/R common/J sense/N to/T know/V what/W that/I demands/V ./.
Their/P commitment/N to/T ``/` creativity/N ''/' can/M not/R survive/V adolescent/J illiteracy/N ./.
American/J education/N 's/P future/N will/M be/V determined/V by/I the/D degree/N to/T which/W we/P --/: all/D of/I us/P --/: allow/V this/D common/J sense/N to/T prevail/V over/I the/D illusions/N that/I we/P also/R share/V ./.
The/D education/N establishment/N will/M fight/V against/I common/J sense/N every/D inch/N of/I the/D way/N ./.
The/D reasons/N are/V complex/J ,/, but/C one/C simple/J reason/N ought/M not/R to/T be/V underestimated/V ./.
``/` Progressive/J education/N ''/' -LRB-/- as/I it/P was/V once/R called/V -RRB-/- is/V far/R more/R interesting/J and/C agreeable/J to/T teachers/N than/I is/V disciplined/V instruction/N ./.
It/P is/V nice/J for/I teachers/N to/T think/V they/P are/V engaged/V in/I ``/` personality/N development/N ''/' and/C even/R nicer/J to/T minimize/V those/D irksome/J tests/N with/I often/R disappointing/J results/N ./.
It/P also/R provides/V teachers/N with/I a/D superior/J self-definition/N as/I a/D ``/` profession/N ,/, ''/' since/I they/P will/M have/V passed/V courses/N in/I educational/J psychology/N and/C educational/J philosophy/N ./.
I/P myself/P took/V such/J courses/N in/I college/N ,/, thinking/V I/P might/M end/V up/I a/D schoolteacher/N ./.
They/P could/M all/R fairly/R be/V described/V as/I ``/` pap/N ''/' courses/N ./.
But/C it/P is/V unfair/J to/T dump/V on/I teachers/N ,/, as/I distinct/J from/I the/D educational/J establishment/N ./.
I/P know/V many/J schoolteachers/N and/C ,/, on/I the/D whole/N ,/, they/P are/V seriously/R committed/V to/T conscientious/J teaching/N ./.
They/P may/M not/R be/V among/I the/D ``/` best/J and/C brightest/J ''/' of/I their/P generation/N --/: there/E are/V very/R few/J such/J people/N ,/, by/I definition/N ./.
But/C they/P need/M not/R be/V to/T do/V their/P jobs/N well/R ./.
Yes/U ,/, we/P all/D can/M remember/V one/C or/C two/C truly/R inspiring/J teachers/N from/I our/P school/N days/N ./.
But/C our/P education/N proceeded/V at/I the/D hands/N of/I those/D others/N ,/, who/W were/V merely/R competent/J and/C conscientious/J ./.
In/I this/D sense/N ,/, a/D teacher/N can/M be/V compared/V to/T one/N 's/P family/N doctor/N ./.
If/I he/P were/V brilliant/J ,/, he/P probably/R would/M not/R be/V a/D family/N doctor/N in/I the/D first/J place/N ./.
If/I he/P is/V competent/J and/C conscientious/J ,/, he/P serves/V us/P well/R ./.
Our/P teachers/N are/V not/R an/D important/J factor/N in/I our/P educational/J crisis/N ./.
Whether/I they/P are/V or/C are/V not/R underpaid/J is/V a/D problem/N of/I equity/N ;/: it/P is/V not/R an/D educational/J problem/N ./.
It/P is/V silly/J libel/N on/I our/P teachers/N to/T think/V they/P would/M educate/V our/P children/N better/J if/I only/R they/P got/V a/D few/J thousand/C dollars/N a/D year/N more/R ./.
It/P is/V the/D kind/N of/I libel/N the/D teachers/N '/P unions/N do/V n't/R mind/V spreading/V ,/, for/I their/P own/J narrow/J purposes/N ./.
It/P is/V also/R the/D kind/N of/I libel/N politicians/N find/V useful/J ,/, since/I it/P helps/V them/P strike/V a/D friendly/J posture/N on/I behalf/N of/I an/D important/J constituency/N ./.
But/C there/E is/V not/R one/C shred/N of/I evidence/N that/I ,/, other/J things/N being/V equal/J ,/, salary/N differentials/N result/V in/I educational/J differentials/N ./.
If/I there/E were/V such/J evidence/N ,/, you/P can/M be/V sure/J you/P would/M have/V heard/V of/I it/P ./.
If/I we/P wish/V to/T be/V serious/J about/I American/J education/N ,/, we/P know/V exactly/R what/W to/T do/V --/: and/C ,/, just/R as/I important/J ,/, what/W not/R to/T do/V ./.
There/E are/V many/J successful/J schools/N scattered/V throughout/I this/D nation/N ,/, some/D of/I them/P in/I the/D poorest/J of/I ghettos/N ,/, and/C they/P are/V all/D sending/V us/P the/D same/J message/N ./.
Conversely/R ,/, there/E are/V the/D majority/N of/I unsuccessful/J schools/N ,/, and/C we/P know/V which/W efforts/N at/I educational/J reform/N are/V doomed/V beforehand/R ./.
We/P really/R do/V know/V all/D we/P need/V to/T know/V ,/, if/I only/R we/P could/M assimilate/V this/D knowledge/N into/I our/P thinking/N ./.
In/I this/D respect/N ,/, it/P would/M be/V helpful/J if/I our/P political/J leaders/N were/V mute/J ,/, rather/R than/I eloquently/R ``/` concerned/V ./. ''/'
They/P are/V inevitably/R inclined/V to/T echo/V the/D conventional/J pap/N ,/, since/I this/D is/V the/D least/J controversial/J option/N that/W is/V open/J to/T them/P ./.
Thus/R at/I the/D recent/J governors/N '/P conference/N on/I education/N ,/, Gov./N Bill/N Clinton/N of/I Arkansas/N announced/V that/I ``/` this/D country/N needs/V a/D comprehensive/J child-development/N policy/N for/I children/N under/I five/C ./. ''/'
A/D comprehensive/J development/N policy/N for/I governors/N over/I 30/C would/M seem/V to/T be/V a/D more/R pressing/J need/N ./.
What/W Gov./N Clinton/N is/V advocating/V ,/, in/I effect/N ,/, is/V extending/V the/D educational/J system/N down/I to/T the/D pre-kindergarten/N years/N ./.
Whether/I desirable/J or/C not/R ,/, this/D is/V a/D child-care/J program/N ,/, not/R an/D educational/J program/N ./.
We/P know/V that/I very/R early/J exposure/N to/T schooling/N improves/V performance/N in/I the/D first/J grade/N ,/, but/C afterward/R the/D difference/N is/V quickly/R washed/V away/R ./.
Let/V us/P sum/V up/I what/W we/P do/V know/V about/I education/N and/C about/I those/D education/N reforms/N that/W do/V work/V and/C do/V n't/R work/V :/: --/: ``/` Parental/J involvement/N ''/' is/V a/D bad/J idea/N ./.
Parents/N are/V too/R likely/J to/T blame/V schools/N for/I the/D educational/J limitations/N of/I their/P children/N ./.
Parents/N should/M be/V involved/V with/I their/P children/N 's/P education/N at/I home/N ,/, not/R in/I school/N ./.
They/P should/M see/V to/T it/P that/I their/P kids/N do/V n't/R play/V truant/J ;/: they/P should/M make/V certain/J that/I the/D children/N spend/V enough/J time/N doing/V homework/N ;/: they/P should/M scrutinize/V the/D report/N card/N ./.
If/I parents/N are/V dissatisfied/V with/I a/D school/N ,/, they/P should/M have/V the/D option/N of/I switching/V to/T another/D ./.
--/: ``/` Community/N involvement/N ''/' is/V an/D even/R worse/J idea/N ./.
Here/R ,/, the/D experience/N of/I New/N York/N City/N is/V decisive/J ./.
Locally/R elected/V school/N boards/N ,/, especially/R in/I our/P larger/J cities/N ,/, become/V the/D prey/N of/I ambitious/J ,/, generally/R corrupt/J ,/, and/C invariably/R demagogic/J local/J politicians/N or/C would-be/J politicians/N ./.
New/N York/N is/V in/I the/D process/N of/I trying/V to/T disengage/V itself/P from/I a/D 20-year-old/J commitment/N to/T this/D system/N of/I school/N governance/N ,/, even/R as/I Chicago/N and/C other/J cities/N are/V moving/V to/T institute/V it/P ./.
--/: In/I most/J states/N ,/, increasing/V expenditures/N on/I education/N ,/, in/I our/P current/J circumstances/N ,/, will/M probably/R make/V things/N worse/J ,/, not/R better/J ./.
The/D reason/N is/V simple/J :/: Education/N takes/V place/N in/I the/D classroom/N ,/, where/W the/D influence/N of/I money/N is/V minimal/J ./.
Decades/N of/I educational/J research/N tell/V us/P unequivocally/R that/I even/R smaller/J classes/N have/V zero/C effect/N on/I the/D academic/J performance/N of/I the/D pupils/N --/: though/I they/P may/M sometimes/R be/V desirable/J for/I other/J reasons/N ./.
The/D new/J money/N flows/V into/I the/D already/R top-heavy/J administrative/J structure/N ,/, which/W busies/N itself/P piling/V more/J and/C more/J paper/N work/N on/I the/D teachers/N ./.
There/E is/V neither/D mystery/N nor/C paradox/N in/I the/D fact/N that/I as/I educational/J expenditures/N -LRB-/- in/I real/J terms/N -RRB-/- have/V increased/V sharply/R in/I the/D past/N quarter-of-a-century/J --/: we/P now/R spend/V more/R per/I pupil/N than/I any/D other/J country/N in/I the/D world/N --/: educational/J performance/N has/V declined/V ./.
That/D is/V the/D way/N the/D system/N works/V ./.
--/: Students/N should/M move/V up/I the/D educational/J ladder/N as/I their/P academic/J potential/N allows/V ./.
No/D student/N should/M be/V permitted/V to/T be/V graduated/V from/I elementary/J school/N without/I having/V mastered/V the/D 3/C R/N 's/V at/I the/D level/N that/W prevailed/V 20/C years/N ago/I ./.
This/D means/V ``/` tracking/N ,/, ''/' whose/W main/J purpose/N is/V less/J to/T permit/V the/D gifted/J youngsters/N to/T flourish/V -LRB-/- though/I that/D is/V clearly/R desirable/J -RRB-/- than/I to/T ensure/V that/I the/D less/R gifted/J get/V the/D necessary/J grounding/N for/I further/J study/N or/C for/I entering/V the/D modern/J world/N of/I work/N ./.
The/D notion/N that/I tracking/N is/V somehow/R ``/` undemocratic/J ''/' is/V absurd/J ./.

American/N Express/N representatives/N apparently/R influenced/V the/D publication/N of/I unfavorable/J articles/N about/I Mr./N Safra/N ./.
The/D company/N later/R apologized/V and/C agreed/V to/T make/V $/$ 8/C million/C in/I contributions/N to/T charities/N chosen/V by/I him/P ./.

Ad/N industry/N executives/N were/V n't/R surprised/J by/I Mr./N Roman/N 's/P decision/N to/T leave/V Ogilvy/N ./.
The/D agency/N ,/, under/I his/P direction/N ,/, bitterly/R fought/V a/D takeover/N attempt/N by/I WPP/N Group/N PLC/N of/I London/N before/I succumbing/V in/I May/N ./.

Known/V as/I a/D traditional/J executive/N ,/, he/P is/V very/R much/R in/I the/D conservative/J American/N Express/N mold/N ./.
Moreover/R ,/, after/I 26/C years/N at/I Ogilvy/N he/P had/V honed/V a/D reputation/N for/I being/V squeaky-clean/J and/C a/D straight/J arrow/N --/: which/W can/M only/R help/V American/N Express/N in/I the/D wake/N of/I the/D Safra/N incident/N ./.
He/P also/R is/V close/R to/T American/N Express/N 's/P chairman/N and/C chief/J executive/J officer/N ,/, James/N D./N Robinson/N III/N ./.
Aside/R from/I working/V with/I Mr./N Robinson/N on/I the/D American/N Express/N advertising/N account/N for/I about/R 11/C years/N ,/, Mr./N Roman/N serves/V on/I several/J of/I the/D same/J charities/N and/C boards/N as/I Mr./N Robinson/N ./.
The/D abrupt/J management/N change/N sparked/V widespread/J speculation/N that/I Mr./N Roman/N had/V been/V pushed/V out/I of/I Ogilvy/N 's/P top/J spot/N by/I Mr./N Sorrell/N ./.
But/C Mr./N Roman/N flatly/R denied/V the/D speculation/N ,/, saying/V Mr./N Sorrell/N had/V tried/V several/J times/N to/T persuade/V him/P to/T stay/V ,/, offering/V various/J incentives/N and/C in/I one/C instance/N sending/V a/D note/N with/I a/D case/N of/I wine/N -LRB-/- The/D wine/N ,/, naturally/R ,/, was/V Seagram/N 's/P brand/N ,/, an/D Ogilvy/N client/N -RRB-/- ./.

Mr./N Sorrell/N ,/, traveling/V in/I the/D Far/N East/N ,/, could/M n't/R be/V reached/V ./.
Mr./N Roman/N said/V American/N Express/N 's/P Mr./N Robinson/N first/R approached/V him/P about/I the/D job/N in/I late/J September/N ./.

Mr./N Roman/N also/R brushed/V aside/R reports/N about/I infighting/N between/I him/P and/C Mr./N Phillips/N ,/, his/P successor/N at/I Ogilvy/N ./.
The/D two/C executives/N could/M hardly/R be/V more/R different/J ./.
Mr./N Roman/N comes/V across/R as/I a/D low-key/J executive/N ;/: Mr./N Phillips/N has/V a/D flashier/J personality/N ./.

Mr./N Roman/N 's/P departure/N is/V n't/R expected/V to/T have/V any/D enormous/J repercussions/N at/I Ogilvy/N ./.

Qintex/N Australia/N paid/V the/D management/N company/N A$/$ 32.6/C million/C in/I the/D latest/J fiscal/J year/N ./.
Mr./N Skase/N said/V most/J of/I the/D money/N went/V to/T other/J parties/N for/I expenses/N such/J as/I rent/N and/C travel/N ,/, but/C a/D smaller/J portion/N is/V owed/V to/T senior/J executives/N and/C others/N for/I management/N services/N ./.

TWO/C COMPANIES/N plan/V to/T market/V a/D new/J chip/N with/I ceramic/J circuits/N that/I store/V data/N even/R when/W the/D power/N is/V off/R ./.
Today/N 's/V most/R widely/R used/V data-storing/J chips/N have/V ``/` volatile/J ''/' memories/N --/: their/P data/N disappear/V if/I they/P are/V n't/R fed/V a/D steady/J diet/N of/I electricity/N ,/, so/I they/P need/V external/J power/N supplies/N ./.
National/N Semiconductor/N Corp./N and/C a/D start-up/N named/V Ramtron/N Corp./N plan/V to/T start/V shipping/V so-called/J ferroelectric/J memories/N ,/, which/W can/M remember/V data/N for/I at/I least/J 10/C years/N without/I any/D current/N flowing/V to/T them/P ./.

Once/I production/N hurdles/N are/V overcome/V ,/, the/D chips/N could/M take/V over/R a/D significant/J part/N of/I the/D market/N ./.
In/I addition/N to/T not/R needing/V an/D outside/J power/N source/N ,/, they/P are/V potentially/R cheaper/J to/T make/V because/I they/P require/V fewer/J manufacturing/N steps/N than/I conventional/J chips/N ./.
Military/J buyers/N have/V shown/V interest/N ,/, National/J says/V ,/, because/I ferroelectric/J chips/N resist/V atomic/J radiation/N ./.
And/C while/I today/N 's/P non-volatile/J chips/N --/: such/J as/I electronically/R erasable/J programmable/J read-only/J memory/N chips/N --/: ca/M n't/R be/V used/V in/I a/D computer/N 's/P central/J memory/N because/I they/P ``/` learn/V ''/' data/N slowly/R ,/, ferroelectric/J chips/N accept/V data/N at/I very/R high/J speeds/N ./.

At/I a/D private/J dinner/N Thursday/N ,/, Drexel/N Burnham/N Lambert/N Inc./N chief/J executive/N Frederick/N Joseph/N delivered/V a/D sobering/J message/N about/I the/D junk/N bond/N market/N to/T officials/N of/I Prudential/N Insurance/N Co./N of/I America/N ./.
Mr./N Joseph/N conceded/V the/D junk/N market/N was/V in/I disarray/N ,/, according/V to/T people/N familiar/J with/I the/D discussion/N ./.
He/P said/V Drexel/N --/: the/D leading/J underwriter/N of/I high-risk/J junk/N bonds/N --/: could/M no/R longer/R afford/V to/T sell/V any/D junk/N offerings/N if/I they/P might/M later/R become/V troubled/J because/I Drexel/N risked/V losing/V its/P highly/R lucrative/J junk/N franchise/N ./.
The/D dinner/N was/V a/D stark/J confirmation/N that/I 1989/C is/V the/D worst/J year/N ever/R for/I the/D $/$ 200/C billion/C junk/N market/N ./.
And/C investors/N and/C traders/N alike/R say/V the/D current/J turmoil/N could/M take/V years/N to/T resolve/V ./.
Amid/I the/D market/N disorder/N ,/, even/R Drexel/N ,/, which/W has/V the/D widest/J and/C most/R loyal/J following/N of/I junk/N bond/N investors/N ,/, is/V pulling/V in/I its/P horns/N ./.
Although/I the/D big/J investment/N bank/N still/R dominates/V the/D junk/N market/N ,/, Drexel/N has/V been/V unable/J to/T stem/V the/D fallout/N from/I growing/V junk/N bond/N defaults/N ,/, withdrawn/V new/J offerings/N ,/, redemptions/N by/I shareholders/N in/I junk/N bond/N mutual/J funds/N and/C an/D exodus/N of/I once-devoted/J investors/N ./.
For/I many/J money/N managers/N ,/, the/D past/J four/C months/N have/V been/V humiliating/J ./.
``/` This/D is/V the/D worst/J shakeout/N ever/R in/I the/D junk/N market/N ,/, and/C it/P could/M take/V years/N before/I it/P 's/V over/R ,/, ''/' says/V Mark/N Bachmann/N ,/, a/D senior/J vice/N president/N at/I Standard/N &/C Poor/N 's/P Corp./N ,/, a/D credit/N rating/N company/N ./.

The/D fragile/J market/N received/V its/P biggest/J jolt/N last/J month/N from/I Campeau/N Corp./N ,/, which/W created/V its/P U.S./N retailing/N empire/N with/I more/J than/I $/$ 3/C billion/C in/I junk/N financing/N ./.
Campeau/N developed/V a/D cash/N squeeze/N that/W caused/V it/P to/T be/V tardy/J on/I some/D interest/N payments/N and/C to/T put/V its/P prestigious/J Bloomingdale/N 's/P department/N store/N chain/N up/R for/I sale/N ./.
At/I that/D point/N ,/, the/D junk/N market/N went/V into/I a/D tailspin/N as/I buyers/N disappeared/V and/C investors/N tried/V to/T sell/V ./.

Indeed/R ,/, the/D stakes/N are/V high/J ./.

``/` Kodak/N understands/V HDTV/N is/V where/W everybody/N is/V going/V ,/, ''/' says/V RIT/N 's/P Mr./N Spaull/N ./.

And/C as/I it/P unfolds/V ,/, it/P 's/V revealing/V some/D of/I the/D more/R tangled/J and/C seamier/J aspects/N of/I Japanese/J society/N ./.
Already/R ,/, ruling/V Liberal/N Democratic/N Party/N demands/N that/I opposition/N members/N testify/V under/I oath/N in/I parliament/N have/V stalled/V one/C budget/N committee/N session/N and/C forced/V the/D committee/N to/T plan/V a/D special/J two-day/J investigation/N at/I the/D end/N of/I the/D month/N ./.

``/` The/D opposition/N can/M be/V the/D most/R hurt/V because/I everyone/N already/R figures/V the/D LDP/N is/V that/D kind/N of/I beast/N ,/, ''/' says/V Shigezo/N Hayasaka/N ,/, former/J aide/N to/T LDP/N kingmaker/N Kakuei/N Tanaka/N and/C now/R an/D independent/J analyst/N ./.

This/D time/N ,/, the/D scandal/N centers/V on/I donations/N made/V by/I the/D not-quite-mainstream/J pachinko/N parlor/N industry/N ./.
Pachinko/N ,/, a/D kind/N of/I pinball/N ,/, is/V Japan/N 's/P favorite/J form/N of/I legal/J gambling/N ./.
The/D donations/N so/R far/R appear/V to/T be/V small/J ,/, especially/R compared/V with/I the/D huge/J sums/N that/W changed/V hands/N in/I the/D Recruit/N Co/N ./. influence-peddling/N scandal/N that/W plagued/V the/D ruling/V party/N last/J year/N ./.
But/C the/D implications/N could/M be/V great/J ./.
Pachinko/N is/V slightly/R on/I the/D shady/J side/N ,/, often/R linked/V to/T the/D lower/J ranks/N of/I Japan/N 's/P underworld/N and/C regularly/R at/I the/D top/N of/I annual/J lists/N of/I tax/N evaders/N ./.
Recently/R the/D industry/N has/V faced/V the/D threat/N of/I new/J restrictions/N ,/, and/C political/J donations/N may/M have/V been/V made/V with/I the/D intent/N to/T bribe/V ./.
Also/R ,/, about/R 60/C %/N of/I pachinko/N parlor/N owners/N are/V Korean/J ,/, many/J of/I whom/W maintain/V close/J ties/N with/I North/J or/C South/J Korean/J residents/N '/P organizations/N ,/, and/C donations/N by/I such/J foreign/J groups/N are/V illegal/J in/I Japan/N ./.
To/T many/J Japanese/N ,/, pachinko/N is/V benign/J or/C enticingly/R unsavory/J ./.
Garish/J neon/N pachinko/N marquees/N blaze/V from/I the/D main/J streets/N and/C narrow/J alleys/N of/I cities/N and/C towns/N across/I the/D country/N ./.
Devotees/N pass/V hours/N ,/, watching/V the/D lights/N blink/V and/C listening/V to/T the/D metal/N balls/N ping/V ,/, as/R much/R to/T gamble/V as/I to/T get/V a/D little/J time/N to/T be/V anonymous/J ,/, alone/R with/I their/P thoughts/N ./.
At/I 500/C yen/N -LRB-/- $/$ 3.60/C -RRB-/- for/I a/D handful/N of/I balls/N ,/, pachinko/N is/V a/D common/J pastime/N ,/, and/C has/V been/V since/I it/P took/V root/N as/I cheap/J entertainment/N in/I the/D years/N after/I World/N War/N II/N ./.
But/C the/D total/N of/I all/P those/D pinging/V balls/N has/V created/V an/D industry/N with/I a/D reported/J annual/J income/N of/I 13/C trillion/C yen/N -LRB-/- almost/R $/$ 92/C billion/C -RRB-/- ,/, or/C nearly/R the/D size/N of/I Japan/N 's/P vaunted/J automobile/N industry/N ./.
And/C because/I the/D pachinko/N industry/N is/V regularly/R at/I the/D top/N of/I annual/J lists/N for/I tax/N evasion/N ,/, some/D observers/N estimate/V the/D real/J income/N could/M be/V as/R much/J as/I 20/C trillion/C yen/N ./.
If/I that/D money/N were/V being/V taxed/V ,/, it/P could/M bring/V the/D government/N a/D badly/R needed/V several/J trillion/C yen/N ./.
In/I 1984/C ,/, an/D attempt/N was/V made/V to/T crack/V down/R on/I the/D industry/N with/I tougher/J restrictions/N ./.
Then/R ,/, in/I 1988/C ,/, a/D proposal/N to/T keep/V better/J track/N of/I income/N by/I selling/V prepaid/J cards/N for/I pachinko/N was/V fielded/V in/I parliament/N ./.
The/D proposal/N split/V the/D industry/N in/I two/C ,/, along/I the/D lines/N of/I national/J origin/N :/: North/N Koreans/N oppose/V the/D plan/N while/I South/N Koreans/N ,/, Japanese/N and/C Taiwanese/N accept/V it/P or/C are/V neutral/J ./.
In/I August/N ,/, a/D conservative/J weekly/J magazine/N reported/V that/I a/D pachinko/N industry/N organization/N donated/V money/N to/T Japan/N Socialist/N Party/N members/N ./.
The/D magazine/N alleged/V that/I in/I making/V the/D donations/N ,/, the/D pachinko/N industry/N may/M have/V been/V offering/V bribes/N to/T win/V support/N in/I the/D battle/N against/I prepaid/J cards/N ,/, or/C it/P may/M have/V been/V laundering/V money/N back/R and/C forth/R between/I the/D JSP/N and/C the/D North/J Korean/J residents/N '/P organization/N ,/, the/D Chosen/N Soren/N ./.
The/D Chosen/N Soren/N and/C the/D JSP/N immediately/R denied/V the/D report/N ./.
And/C at/I first/J ,/, neither/C the/D opposition/N nor/C the/D LDP/N wanted/V to/T pursue/V the/D issue/N ./.
But/C the/D press/N kept/V it/P alive/J ;/: as/R with/I the/D Recruit/N scandal/N ,/, lists/N began/V circulating/V with/I names/N of/I people/N who/W had/V received/V money/N ./.
Within/I a/D matter/N of/I weeks/N ,/, less-conservative/J magazines/N reported/V that/I members/N of/I the/D ruling/V LDP/N had/V received/V much/R larger/J donations/N from/I pachinko/N organizations/N ./.
So/R far/R ,/, though/R ,/, there/E have/V been/V no/D allegations/N that/I the/D contributions/N the/D LDP/N members/N received/V amounted/V to/T bribes/N ./.
Then/R the/D two/C camps/N upped/V the/D ante/N :/: Reports/N that/I Chosen/N Soren/N had/V donated/V directly/R to/T JSP/N members/N were/V rapidly/R countered/V by/I statements/N that/I the/D South/J Korean/J residents/N '/P organization/N had/V long/R been/V donating/V directly/R to/T LDP/N members/N ./.
The/D JSP/N admitted/V Oct./N 13/C that/I its/P members/N received/V about/R eight/C million/C yen/N from/I the/D pachinko/N organization/N ,/, and/C charged/V LDP/N members/N with/I receiving/V 125/C million/C yen/N -LRB-/- $/$ 880,000/C -RRB-/- and/C other/J opposition/N parties/N with/I taking/V about/R 2.5/C million/C yen/N ./.
On/I Friday/N ,/, the/D chief/J cabinet/N secretary/N announced/V that/I eight/C cabinet/N ministers/N had/V received/V five/C million/C yen/N from/I the/D industry/N ,/, including/V 450,000/C yen/N -LRB-/- $/$ 3,175/C -RRB-/- by/I Prime/N Minister/N Toshiki/N Kaifu/N ./.
No/D one/N has/V alleged/V that/I the/D donations/N were/V by/I themselves/P illegal/J ./.
Direct/J donations/N from/I either/D of/I the/D residents/N '/P organizations/N would/M be/V illegal/J because/I the/D groups/N are/V defined/V as/I foreign/J ,/, but/C both/D groups/N deny/V making/V direct/J donations/N ./.
They/P say/V possible/J some/D of/I their/P members/N may/M be/V donating/V privately/R ./.
The/D issue/N is/V further/R complicated/V because/I although/I the/D organizations/N represent/V Korean/J residents/N ,/, those/D residents/N were/V largely/R born/V and/C raised/V in/I Japan/N and/C many/J speak/V only/R Japanese/N ./.
That/I they/P retain/V Korean/J citizenship/N and/C ties/N is/V a/D reflection/N of/I history/N --/: their/P parents/N were/V shipped/V in/R as/I laborers/N during/I the/D decades/N when/W Japan/N occupied/V Korea/N before/I World/N War/N II/N --/: and/C the/D discrimination/N that/W still/R faces/V Koreans/N in/I Japanese/J society/N ./.
Many/J Japanese/N think/V it/P only/R natural/N that/I the/D organizations/N or/C their/P members/N would/M donate/V to/T politicians/N ,/, the/D way/N many/J Japanese/N do/V ,/, to/T win/V favor/N or/C support/N ./.
Both/D residents/N '/P organizations/N admit/V to/T receiving/V some/D funding/N from/I abroad/R ./.
But/C LDP/N members/N and/C supporters/N of/I the/D prepaid/J card/N idea/N tend/V to/T speak/V in/I innuendo/N about/I the/D JSP/N 's/P alleged/J donations/N ,/, implying/V that/I North/J Korean/J money/N would/M be/V more/R suspect/J than/I South/J Korean/J because/I North/N Korea/N is/V communist/J and/C South/N Korea/N is/V an/D ally/N ./.

During/I the/D almost/R seven-year-old/J economic/J expansion/N ,/, inflation-adjusted/J gross/J national/J product/N ,/, disposable/J personal/J income/N and/C personal/J consumption/N expenditures/N have/V risen/V 30/C %/N ,/, but/C inflation-adjusted/J consumer/N installment/N credit/N has/V surged/V 66/C %/N ./.

However/R ,/, these/D figures/N do/V n't/R seem/V to/T worry/V Thomas/N A./N Durkin/N ,/, an/D economist/N at/I the/D Federal/N Reserve/N Board/N ./.
In/I a/D paper/N presented/V at/I the/D recent/J annual/J meeting/N of/I the/D National/N Association/N of/I Business/N Economists/N in/I San/N Francisco/N ,/, Mr./N Durkin/N comments/N that/I ``/` installment/J credit/N always/R grows/V rapidly/R in/I cyclical/J advances/N ,/, and/C growth/N in/I this/D cycle/N is/V very/R typical/J of/I earlier/J experiences/N ./.

But/C what/W about/I the/D debt/N burden/N ?/.
Mr./N Durkin/N doubts/V that/I ``/` there/E is/V some/D magic/J level/N ''/' at/I which/W the/D ratio/N of/I installment/N debt/N to/T disposable/J income/N ``/` indicates/V economic/J problems/N ./. ''/'
And/C ,/, ``/` more/R importantly/R ,/, ''/' he/P says/V ,/, ``/` the/D debt/N burden/N measured/V other/J ways/N is/V not/R really/R in/I uncharted/J waters/N ./. ''/'
The/D chart/N below/R shows/N why/W -LRB-/- see/V accompanying/V illustration/N --/: WSJ/N Oct./N 23/C ,/, 1989/C -RRB-/- ./.
The/D ratio/N of/I consumer/N installment/N credit/N to/T disposable/J income/N ,/, though/I up/R a/D bit/N ,/, has/V n't/R climbed/V steeply/R ,/, and/C such/J debt/N as/I a/D percent/N of/I household/N assets/N is/V little/R changed/V ./.
Moreover/R ,/, the/D burden/N of/I consumer/N credit/N payments/N relative/J to/T disposable/J income/N may/M be/V ``/` lower/J in/I this/D cycle/N than/I earlier/R ,/, ''/' Mr./N Durkin/N says/V ./.
He/P notes/V that/I some/D ``/` revolving/J credit-card/N credit/N is/V actually/R convenience/N credit/N ''/' being/V used/V simply/R as/I a/D handy/J way/N of/I paying/V bills/N rather/R than/I a/D handy/J way/N of/I borrowing/V ./.
In/I addition/N ,/, he/P says/V ,/, ``/` longer/J maturities/N on/I automobile/N and/C other/J forms/N of/I installment/N credit/N boost/V the/D stock/N of/I debt/N faster/R than/I the/D flow/N of/I repayments/N and/C the/D accompanying/J payment/N burden/N ./. ''/'
And/C if/I you/P ``/` consider/V the/D changing/V distribution/N of/I credit/N ,/, ''/' Mr./N Durkin/N says/V ,/, ``/` much/J of/I the/D increase/N in/I debt/N in/I recent/J years/N is/V due/J to/T increasing/V credit/N use/N by/I higher-income/J families/N ,/, ''/' that/D is/V ,/, ``/` those/D probably/R best/R able/J to/T handle/V it/P ./. ''/'
Citing/V figures/N on/I home-equity/J loans/N ,/, he/P notes/V that/I ``/` 11/C %/N of/I homeowners/N had/V home-equity/J credit/N accounts/N ,/, but/C the/D proportion/N rises/V to/T 16/C %/N of/I homeowners/N in/I the/D $/$ 45,000-$60,000/C income/N range/N and/C 23/C %/N of/I homeowners/N with/I income/N above/I $/$ 60,000/C ./.

And/C much/J home-equity/J credit/N is/V used/V conservatively/R ./.
``/` The/D most/R frequent/J use/N is/V home/N improvement/N ,/, which/W presumably/R improves/V the/D value/N of/I the/D property/N ,/, ''/' Mr./N Durkin/N says/V ./.
So/R ,/, it/P is/V n't/R surprising/J that/I consumer-credit/J delinquencies/N at/I banks/N remain/V ,/, as/I the/D chart/N shows/V ,/, reassuringly/R below/I some/D earlier/J highs/N -LRB-/- see/V accompanying/V illustration/N --/: WSJ/N Oct./N 23/C ,/, 1989/C -RRB-/- ./.

In/I fact/N ,/, the/D current/J weakness/N in/I auto/N buying/N and/C department-store/N sales/N and/C the/D gradual/J upturn/N in/I the/D household/N saving/N rate/N suggest/V that/I consumers/N ,/, conservative/J as/I ever/R ,/, are/V already/R clutching/V their/P purses/N a/D bit/N more/R tightly/R ./.

China/N could/M exhaust/V its/P foreign-exchange/N reserves/N as/R early/R as/I next/J year/N ,/, a/D Western/J government/N report/N says/V ,/, unless/I imports/N are/V cut/V drastically/R to/T help/V narrow/V the/D balance-of-payments/J deficit/N ./.
According/V to/T the/D report/N ,/, completed/V last/J month/N ,/, if/I China/N 's/P trade/N gap/N continues/V to/T widen/V at/I the/D pace/N seen/V in/I the/D first/J seven/C months/N of/I this/D year/N ,/, the/D reserves/N would/M be/V wiped/V out/R either/C in/I 1990/C or/C 1991/C ./.
A/D country/N is/V considered/V financially/R healthy/J if/I its/P reserves/N cover/V three/C months/N of/I its/P imports/N ./.
The/D $/$ 14/C billion/C of/I reserves/N China/N had/V in/I June/N would/M cover/V just/R that/R much/J ./.
The/D report/N by/I the/D Western/J government/N ,/, which/W declines/V to/T be/V identified/V ,/, concludes/V that/I ``/` a/D near-term/J foreign-exchange/N payment/N problem/N can/M be/V avoided/V only/R if/I import/N growth/N drops/V to/T below/I 5/C %/N per/I annum/N ./. ''/'
According/V to/T Chinese/J customs/N figures/N ,/, import/N growth/N has/V slowed/V in/I recent/J months/N ,/, dropping/V to/T 16/C %/N in/I July/N and/C 7.1/C %/N in/I August/N from/I the/D year-earlier/J periods/N ,/, compared/V with/I an/D average/J growth/N rate/N of/I 26/C %/N in/I the/D first/J half/N ./.
But/C before/I import/N growth/N slowed/V ,/, China/N 's/P buying/N spree/N in/I the/D first/J half/N already/R had/V taken/V its/P toll/N on/I foreign-exchange/N reserves/N ./.
The/D $/$ 14/C billion/C level/N in/I June/N marked/V a/D drop/N from/I $/$ 19/C billion/C at/I the/D end/N of/I April/N ./.
China/N 's/P last/J big/J import/N binge/N sent/V reserves/N tumbling/V to/T $/$ 10.6/C billion/C in/I June/N 1985/C from/I $/$ 16.6/C billion/C the/D previous/J September/N ./.
China/N might/M stave/V off/R a/D crisis/N if/I it/P acts/V as/R forcefully/R as/I it/P did/V to/T arrest/V the/D 1985/C decline/N ,/, when/W Beijing/N slammed/V the/D brakes/N on/I foreign-exchange/N spending/N and/C devalued/V the/D currency/N ./.
But/C this/D time/N ,/, China/N faces/V a/D more/R difficult/J battle/N because/I of/I economic/J forces/N that/W have/V come/V into/I play/N since/I the/D Tiananmen/N Square/N killings/N June/N 4/C ./.
For/I example/N ,/, China/N 's/P hard-currency/N income/N is/V expected/V to/T suffer/V from/I the/D big/J drop/N in/I tourist/N arrivals/N since/I June/N 4/C ./.
Revenue/N from/I tourism/N this/D year/N is/V projected/V to/T total/V $/$ 1.3/C billion/C ,/, down/R from/I $/$ 2.2/C billion/C last/J year/N ./.
Because/I of/I this/D and/C the/D huge/J trade/N gap/N ,/, the/D deficit/N in/I China/N 's/P current/J account/N ,/, which/W measures/V trade/N in/I goods/N and/C services/N plus/C certain/J unilateral/J transfers/N of/I funds/N ,/, is/V expected/V to/T widen/V sharply/R from/I the/D $/$ 3.8/C billion/C deficit/N last/J year/N ./.
The/D Western/J government/N report/N suggests/V a/D number/N of/I scenarios/N for/I China/N 's/P current-account/J balance/N ,/, two/C of/I which/W are/V considered/V most/R likely/R ./.
In/I one/C ,/, imports/N and/C exports/N continue/V to/T grow/V at/I the/D respective/J average/J rates/N of/I 25/C %/N and/C 5/C %/N recorded/V during/I the/D first/J seven/C months/N ,/, and/C the/D current-account/J deficit/N widens/V to/T $/$ 13.1/C billion/C ./.
In/I 1985/C ,/, China/N had/V a/D record/J deficit/N of/I $/$ 11.4/C billion/C ./.
The/D other/J scenario/N assumes/V that/I Beijing/N takes/V effective/J actions/N to/T curb/V imports/N in/I the/D coming/J months/N ./.
In/I this/D case/N ,/, China/N would/M still/R finish/V the/D year/N with/I a/D current-account/J deficit/N of/I $/$ 8.7/C billion/C ,/, based/V on/I projections/N that/I imports/N for/I all/D of/I this/D year/N grow/V 20/C %/N and/C exports/V 10/C %/N ./.
If/I China/N were/V still/R on/I good/J terms/N with/I foreign/J lenders/N ,/, it/P might/M be/V able/J to/T stem/V the/D drain/N on/I its/P foreign-exchange/J reserves/N by/I using/V some/D loan/N funds/N to/T offset/V the/D current-account/J deficit/N ./.
But/C since/I June/N ,/, foreign/J bankers/N led/V by/I international/J financial/J institutions/N have/V virtually/R suspended/V their/P new/J loans/N to/T China/N ./.
Even/R if/I borrowing/N resumes/N ,/, commercial/J bankers/N are/V n't/R expected/V to/T lend/V as/R much/J as/I before/R ./.
In/I addition/N ,/, economists/N are/V forecasting/V a/D slowdown/N in/I foreign/J direct/J investments/N as/I businessmen/N become/V increasingly/R wary/J of/I China/N 's/P deteriorating/V political/J and/C economic/J environment/N ./.
On/I top/N of/I all/P this/D ,/, foreign-debt/N repayments/N are/V expected/V to/T peak/V in/I 1991/C to/T 1992/C ./.
With/I less/J capital/N coming/V in/R ,/, China/N 's/P balance/N of/I payments/N would/M suffer/V ./.
The/D Western/J government/N report/N 's/P first/J scenario/N assumes/V a/D 30/C %/N reduction/N in/I foreign/J borrowing/N and/C a/D 5/C %/N contraction/N in/I foreign/J direct/J investment/N ./.
In/I the/D second/J ,/, foreign/J borrowing/N is/V projected/V to/T grow/V 10/C %/N and/C investment/N to/T drop/V 10/C %/N ./.
But/C in/I either/D case/N ,/, the/D report/N says/V ,/, China/N 's/P balance/N of/I payments/N would/M rapidly/R dry/V up/R foreign/J reserves/N ,/, which/W are/V used/V to/T finance/V the/D imbalance/N ./.
In/I the/D first/J scenario/N ,/, the/D reserves/N would/M be/V exhausted/V next/J year/N ,/, and/C in/I the/D second/J they/P would/M be/V wiped/V out/R in/I 1991/C ./.

The/D White/N Plains/N ,/, N.Y./N ,/, oil/N company/N said/V Friday/N that/I it/P had/V acquired/V Tana/N Production/N Corp./N ,/, a/D subsidiary/N of/I TRT/N Energy/N Holdings/N Inc./N ,/, for/I $/$ 95.1/C million/C in/I cash/N ,/, with/I the/D rest/N to/T be/V paid/V in/I shares/N of/I a/D new/J ,/, non-voting/J issue/N of/I preferred/J stock/N ./.
Tana/N ,/, which/W holds/V properties/N in/I 17/C oil/N and/C gas/N fields/N in/I south/J Texas/N ,/, will/M provide/V Texaco/N with/I mostly/R gas/N reserves/N ./.
The/D fields/N contain/V recoverable/J reserves/N of/I 435/C billion/C cubic/J feet/N of/I natural/J gas/N and/C four/C million/C barrels/N of/I oil/N ./.
``/` This/D acquisition/N is/V another/D indication/N of/I Texaco/N 's/P commitment/N to/T increase/V the/D company/N 's/P reserve/N base/N ,/, ''/' said/V Chief/N Executive/N Officer/N James/N W./N Kinnear/N ./.
Texaco/N has/V also/R been/V attempting/V to/T sell/V oil/N properties/N ./.
At/I least/J two/C years/N ago/R ,/, the/D company/N put/V 60/C million/C barrels/N of/I oil/N reserves/N on/I the/D block/N ./.
They/P were/V either/C too/R small/J or/C uneconomic/J to/T maintain/V ,/, the/D company/N said/V ./.
Not/R all/D of/I those/D parcels/N have/V yet/R been/V sold/V ./.
Texaco/N acquired/V Tana/N before/I it/P completed/V those/D sales/N because/I Tana/N 's/P properties/N are/V high/J quality/N and/C near/I other/J fields/N Texaco/N already/R owns/V ,/, a/D company/N spokeswoman/N said/V ./.
Texaco/N ,/, like/I many/J other/J oil/N companies/N ,/, has/V been/V struggling/V to/T replace/V its/P falling/V oil/N and/C gas/N reserves/N ./.
Texaco/N 's/P situation/N had/V become/V particularly/R complex/J because/I much/J of/I its/P effort/N had/V for/I years/N been/V focused/V on/I its/P brawl/N with/I Pennzoil/N and/C then/R on/I New/N York/N investor/N Carl/N C./N Icahn/N 's/P attempt/N to/T take/V over/R the/D company/N ./.
Pennzoil/N had/V sued/V Texaco/N for/I improperly/R interfering/V with/I its/P acquisition/N of/I a/D portion/N of/I Getty/N Oil/N Co/N ./.
Eventually/R ,/, Texaco/N ,/, which/W was/V forced/V into/I bankruptcy/N proceedings/N by/I that/D litigation/N ,/, settled/V its/P fight/N with/I Pennzoil/N for/I $/$ 3/C billion/C in/I 1986/C ./.
Mr./N Icahn/N ,/, who/W played/V a/D key/J role/N in/I the/D settlement/N and/C attempted/V subsequently/R to/T take/V control/N of/I the/D company/N ,/, sold/V his/P stake/N in/I Texaco/N just/R last/J summer/N ./.
Completion/N of/I Texaco/N 's/P acquisition/N of/I Tana/N is/V subject/J to/T government/N approval/N under/I the/D Hart-Scott-Rodino/N Antitrust/N Improvements/N Act/N ./.
CRI/N Inc./N said/V it/P reduced/V the/D estimated/V cash/N distribution/N for/I its/P Capital/N Housing/N and/C Mortgage/N Partners/N Inc./N trust/N to/T between/I 71/C cents/N and/C 74/C cents/N a/D share/N ,/, from/I between/I 75/C cents/N and/C 80/C cents/N ,/, for/I the/D year/N ending/V June/N 9/C ,/, 1990/C ./.
The/D change/N in/I expected/J cash/N distributions/N from/I the/D Champs/N real/J estate/N investment/N trust/N stems/V from/I a/D revised/V estimate/N of/I administrative/J costs/N ,/, said/V Jay/N R./N Cohen/N ,/, Champs/N executive/N vice/N president/N ./.
CRI/N ,/, which/W sponsors/V Champs/N ,/, is/V a/D world-wide/J real/J estate/N investment/N firm/N ./.
H&R/N BLOCK/N Inc./N had/V net/J income/N of/I $/$ 100.2/C million/C ,/, or/C $/$ 1.90/C a/D share/N ,/, in/I the/D fiscal/J year/N ended/V April/N 30/C ./.
The/D figure/N was/V incorrectly/R shown/V as/I a/D net/J loss/N in/I a/D chart/N accompanying/V Friday/N 's/P Heard/V on/I the/D Street/N column/N ./.
Your/P Oct./N 2/C article/N on/I Daniel/N Yankelovich/N cited/V the/D quote/N ``/` A/D good/J name/N is/V better/J than/I great/J riches/N ''/' as/I being/V from/I Cervantes/N '/P ``/` Don/N Quixote/N ./. ''/'

Groupe/N AG/N 's/P chairman/N said/V the/D Belgian/J insurer/N is/V prepared/J to/T give/V up/R some/D of/I its/P independence/N to/T a/D white/J knight/N if/I necessary/J to/T repel/V a/D raider/N ./.
Amid/I heavy/J buying/N of/I shares/N in/I Belgium/N 's/P largest/J insurer/N ,/, Maurice/N Lippens/N also/R warned/V in/I an/D interview/N that/I a/D white/J knight/N ,/, in/I buying/V out/R a/D raider/N ,/, could/M leave/V speculators/N with/I big/J losses/N on/I their/P AG/N stock/N ./.
Since/I the/D beginning/N of/I the/D year/N ,/, the/D stock/N has/V nearly/R doubled/V ,/, giving/V AG/N a/D market/N value/N of/I about/I 105/C billion/C Belgian/J francs/N -LRB-/- $/$ 2.7/C billion/C -RRB-/- ./.
The/D most/R likely/J white/J knight/N would/M be/V Societe/N Generale/N de/F Belgique/N S.A./N ,/, which/W already/R owns/V 18/C %/N of/I AG/N and/C which/W itself/P is/V controlled/V by/I Cie/N ./. Financiere/N de/F Suez/N ,/, the/D acquisitive/J French/J financial/J conglomerate/N ./.
But/C Mr./N Lippens/N said/V a/D rescue/N also/R could/M involve/V Asahi/N Mutual/N Life/N Insurance/N Co./N ,/, which/W owns/V 5/C %/N of/I AG/N ./.
AG/N is/V hardly/R alone/R in/I its/P anxiety/N ./.
A/D rambunctious/J shake-up/N is/V quickly/R reshaping/V Europe/N 's/P once-stately/J insurance/N business/N ./.
Worried/J by/I European/N Community/N directives/N that/W will/M remove/V many/J of/I the/D barriers/N to/T cross-border/J insurance/N services/N ,/, starting/V in/I mid-1990/N ,/, insurers/N are/V rushing/V to/T find/V partners/N and/C preparing/V for/I price/N wars/N ./.
In/I West/N Germany/N and/C the/D Netherlands/N ,/, insurers/N are/V flirting/V with/I banks/N ./.
In/I France/N ,/, Suez/N and/C Axa-Midi/N Assurances/N S.A./N both/D have/V been/V on/I the/D prowl/N for/I giant/J acquisitions/N ;/: Suez/N last/J month/N acquired/V control/N of/I Groupe/N Victoire/N ,/, the/D sixth-largest/J European/J insurance/N company/N ,/, after/I a/D takeover/N battle/N with/I Cie/N ./. Industrielle/N ./.
Mr./N Lippens/N said/V the/D volume/N of/I shares/N changing/V hands/N has/V grown/V significantly/R since/I mid-September/N ./.
But/C he/P estimated/V that/I a/D raider/N would/M have/V been/V able/J to/T amass/V no/D more/J than/I 4/C %/N of/I the/D shares/N in/I recent/J months/N ./.
Aside/R from/I exploring/V plans/N for/I joint/J ventures/N or/C acquisitions/N ,/, Mr./N Lippens/N has/V called/V top/J managers/N of/I companies/N rumored/V as/I potential/J raiders/N --/: among/I them/P ,/, Axa-Midi/N ,/, Union/N des/F Assurances/N de/F Paris/N and/C Suez/N ,/, all/D based/V in/I France/N ./.
They/P have/V all/D ``/` very/R clearly/R stated/V that/I they/P have/V not/R acquired/V and/C are/V not/R acquiring/V shares/N of/I AG/N ,/, ''/' he/P said/V ./.
Any/D raider/N would/M find/V it/P hard/J to/T crack/V AG/N 's/P battlements/N ./.
A/D ``/` syndicate/N ''/' of/I shareholders/N holds/V just/R under/I 50/C %/N of/I AG/N ,/, Mr./N Lippens/N said/V ,/, and/C members/N have/V agreed/V to/T give/V one/N another/D the/D right/N of/I first/J refusal/N should/M they/P sell/V any/D AG/N shares/N ./.
Aside/R from/I Generale/N de/F Belgique/N and/C Asahi/N ,/, the/D syndicate/N includes/V Antwerpsche/N Hypotheekkas/N ,/, a/D Belgian/J savings/N bank/N ,/, and/C various/J family/N interests/N ./.
A/D Generale/N spokesman/N confirmed/V that/I the/D giant/J Belgian/J holding/V company/N would/M be/V willing/J to/T raise/V its/P stake/N in/I AG/N should/M a/D raider/N seek/V control/N ./.
Asahi/N officials/N could/M n't/R be/V reached/V for/I comment/N ./.
Even/R without/I bid/N talk/N ,/, this/D year/N 's/P surge/N in/I prices/N for/I Brussels/N real/J estate/N has/V excited/V interest/N in/I AG/N ./.
The/D company/N says/V those/D holdings/N constitute/V the/D third-biggest/J real-estate/N portfolio/N in/I Belgium/N ./.
With/I the/D dust/N settling/V from/I the/D failed/V coup/N attempt/N in/I Panama/N ,/, one/C of/I the/D many/J lingering/V questions/N the/D Bush/N administration/N will/M ponder/V is/V this/D :/: Is/V the/D National/N Security/N Council/N staff/N big/J enough/R ,/, and/C does/V it/P have/V enough/J clout/N ,/, to/T do/V its/P job/N of/I coordinating/V foreign/J policy/N ?/.
President/N Bush/N 's/P national/J security/N adviser/N ,/, Lt./N Gen./N Brent/N Scowcroft/N ,/, came/V into/I office/N in/I January/N intent/J on/I making/V the/D NSC/N staff/N leaner/J and/C more/R disciplined/J than/I it/P had/V been/V during/I the/D Reagan/N administration/N ./.
Gen./N Scowcroft/N was/V a/D member/N of/I the/D Tower/N Commission/N ,/, which/W investigated/V the/D Iran-Contra/N affair/N ./.
He/P was/V all/R too/R aware/J of/I how/W a/D large/J ,/, inadequately/R supervised/J NSC/N staff/N had/V spun/V out/I of/I control/N and/C nearly/R wrecked/V President/N Reagan/N 's/P second/J term/N ./.
So/R ,/, following/V both/D the/D style/N he/P pursued/V as/I President/N Ford/N 's/P national/J security/N adviser/N and/C the/D recommendations/N of/I the/D Tower/N Commission/N ,/, Gen./N Scowcroft/N has/V pruned/V the/D NSC/N staff/N and/C tried/V to/T ensure/V that/I it/P sticks/V to/T its/P assigned/J tasks/N --/: namely/R ,/, gathering/V the/D views/N of/I the/D State/N Department/N ,/, Pentagon/N and/C intelligence/N community/N ;/: serving/V as/I an/D honest/J broker/N in/I distilling/V that/D information/N for/I the/D president/N and/C then/R making/V sure/J presidential/J decisions/N are/V carried/V out/R ./.
The/D Tower/N Commission/N specifically/R said/V that/I the/D NSC/N staff/N should/M be/V ``/` small/J ''/' and/C warned/V against/I letting/V ``/` energetic/J self-starters/N ''/' like/I Lt./N Col./N Oliver/N North/N strike/V out/I on/I their/P own/J rather/R than/I leaving/V the/D day-to-day/J execution/N of/I policies/N to/T the/D State/N Department/N ,/, Pentagon/N or/C Central/N Intelligence/N Agency/N ./.
However/R ,/, the/D Panama/N episode/N has/V raised/V questions/N about/I whether/I the/D NSC/N staff/N is/V sufficiently/R big/J ,/, diverse/J and/C powerful/J to/T coordinate/V U.S./N policy/N on/I tough/J issues/N ./.
During/I the/D coup/N attempt/N and/C its/P aftermath/N ,/, NSC/N staffers/N were/V ``/` stretched/V very/R thin/J ,/, ''/' says/V one/C senior/J administration/N official/N ./.
``/` It/P 's/V a/D very/R small/J shop/N ./. ''/'
Gen./N Scowcroft/N does/V n't/R plan/V to/T increase/V the/D staff/N right/R now/R ,/, but/C is/V weighing/V that/D possibility/N ,/, the/D official/N adds/V ./.
The/D NSC/N staff/N ``/` does/V n't/R have/V the/D horsepower/N that/I I/P believe/V is/V required/V to/T have/V an/D effective/J interagency/N process/N ,/, ''/' says/V Frank/N Gaffney/N ,/, a/D former/J Pentagon/N aide/N who/W now/R runs/V the/D Center/N for/I Security/N Policy/N ,/, a/D conservative/J Washington/N think-tank/N ./.
The/D problem/N with/I this/D administration/N ,/, I/P think/V ,/, is/V that/I by/I design/N it/P has/V greatly/R diminished/V ,/, both/D in/I a/D physical/J sense/N and/C in/I a/D procedural/J sense/N ,/, the/D role/N of/I the/D NSC/N ./. ''/'
The/D National/N Security/N Council/N itself/P was/V established/V in/I 1947/C because/I policy/N makers/N sensed/V a/D need/N ,/, in/I an/D increasingly/R complex/J world/N ,/, for/I a/D formal/J system/N within/I the/D White/N House/N to/T make/V sure/J that/I communications/N flowed/V smoothly/R between/I the/D president/N and/C the/D State/N Department/N ,/, Pentagon/N and/C intelligence/N agencies/N ./.
By/I law/N ,/, the/D council/N includes/V the/D president/N ,/, vice/N president/N and/C secretaries/N of/I state/N and/C defense/N ./.
In/I practice/N ,/, the/D director/N of/I central/J intelligence/N and/C chairman/N of/I the/D Joint/N Chiefs/N of/I Staff/N also/R serve/V as/I unofficial/J members/N ./.
But/C the/D size/N ,/, shape/N and/C role/N of/I the/D NSC/N staff/N have/V been/V left/V for/I each/D president/N and/C his/P national/J security/N adviser/N to/T decide/V ./.
That/D task/N is/V one/C of/I Washington/N 's/P perennial/J problems/N ./.
