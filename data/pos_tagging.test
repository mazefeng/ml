They/P can/M ignore/V the/D S&P/N 500/C stocks/N altogether/R and/C focus/V on/I particular/J types/N of/I stocks/N ,/, such/J as/I smaller/J companies/N ,/, those/D paying/V high/J dividends/N or/C companies/N in/I a/D particular/J industry/N ,/, state/N or/C country/N ./.

It/P 's/V tempting/J to/T think/V these/D defensive/J steps/N can/M be/V delayed/V until/I a/D recession/N is/V clearly/R at/I hand/N ./.
But/C that/D may/M not/R be/V possible/J ,/, because/I recessions/N often/R take/V investors/N by/I surprise/N ./.
``/` They/P always/R seem/V to/T come/V a/D bit/N later/R than/I you/P expect/V ./.
When/W they/P do/V hit/V ,/, they/P hit/V fast/R ,/, ''/' says/V David/N A./N Wyss/N ,/, chief/J financial/J economist/N at/I the/D Data/N Resources/N division/N of/I McGraw-Hill/N Inc/N ./.
Though/I he/P himself/P does/V n't/R expect/V a/D recession/N soon/R ,/, Mr./N Wyss/N advises/V people/N who/W do/V that/I ``/` the/D best/J thing/N to/T be/V in/I is/V long/J that/D is/V ,/, 20-year/J to/T 30-year/J Treasury/N bonds/N ./. ''/'
The/D reason/N is/V simple/J ,/, Mr./N Wyss/N says/V :/: ``/` Interest/N rates/N almost/R always/R decline/V during/I recession/N ./. ''/'
As/R surely/R as/I a/D seesaw/N tilts/V ,/, falling/V interest/N rates/N force/V up/R the/D price/N of/I previously/R issued/V bonds/N ./.
They/P are/V worth/J more/J because/I they/P pay/V higher/J interest/N than/I newly/R issued/V bonds/N do/V ./.
That/D effect/N holds/V true/J for/I both/D short-term/J and/C long-term/J bonds/N ./.
But/C short-term/J bonds/N ca/M n't/R rise/V too/R much/R ,/, because/I everyone/N knows/V they/P will/M be/V redeemed/V at/I a/D preset/J price/N fairly/R soon/R ./.
Long-term/J bonds/N ,/, with/I many/J years/N left/V before/I maturity/N ,/, swing/V more/R widely/R in/I price/N ./.
But/C not/R just/R any/D bonds/N will/M do/V ./.
Corporate/J bonds/N ``/` are/V usually/R not/R a/D good/J bet/N in/I a/D recession/N ,/, ''/' Mr./N Wyss/N says/V ./.
As/I times/N get/V tougher/J ,/, investors/N fret/V about/I whether/I companies/N will/M have/V enough/J money/N to/T pay/V their/P debts/N ./.
This/D hurts/V the/D price/N of/I corporate/J bonds/N ./.
Also/R ,/, he/P notes/V ,/, ``/` most/J corporate/J bonds/N are/V callable/J ./. ''/'
That/D means/V that/I a/D corporation/N ,/, after/I a/D specified/V amount/N of/I time/N has/V passed/V ,/, can/M buy/V back/R its/P bonds/N by/I paying/V investors/N the/D face/N value/N -LRB-/- plus/C ,/, in/I some/D cases/N ,/, a/D sweetener/N -RRB-/- ./.
When/W interest/N rates/N have/V dropped/V ,/, it/P makes/V sense/N for/I corporations/N to/T do/V just/R that/D ;/: they/P then/R save/V on/I interest/N costs/N ./.
But/C the/D investors/N are/V left/V stranded/V with/I money/N to/T reinvest/V at/I a/D time/N when/W interest/N rates/N are/V puny/J ./.
If/I corporate/J bonds/N are/V bad/J in/I recessions/N ,/, junk/N bonds/N are/V likely/J to/T be/V the/D worst/J of/I all/D ./.
It/P 's/V an/D ``/` absolute/J necessity/N ''/' to/T get/V out/I of/I junk/N bonds/N when/W a/D recession/N is/V in/I the/D offing/N ,/, says/V Avner/N Arbel/N ,/, professor/N of/I finance/N at/I Cornell/N University/N ./.
``/` Such/J bonds/N are/V very/R sensitive/J to/T the/D downside/N ,/, and/C this/D could/M be/V a/D disaster/N ./. ''/'
Municipal/J bonds/N are/V generally/R a/D bit/N safer/J than/I corporate/J bonds/N in/I a/D recession/N ,/, but/C not/R as/R safe/J as/I bonds/N issued/V by/I the/D federal/J government/N ./.
During/I an/D economic/J slump/N ,/, local/J tax/N revenues/N often/R go/V down/R ,/, raising/V the/D risks/N associated/V with/I at/I least/J some/D municipals/N ./.
And/C ,/, like/I corporates/N ,/, many/J municipal/J bonds/N are/V callable/J ./.
But/C a/D few/J experts/N ,/, going/V against/I the/D consensus/N ,/, do/V n't/R think/V bonds/N would/M help/V investors/N even/R if/I a/D recession/N is/V in/I the/D offing/N ./.
One/C of/I these/D is/V Jeffrey/N L./N Beach/N ,/, director/N of/I research/N for/I Underwood/N Neuhaus/N &/C Co./N ,/, a/D brokerage/N house/N in/I Houston/N ,/, who/W thinks/V that/I ``/` we/P 're/V either/C in/I a/D recession/N or/C about/I to/T go/V into/I one/C ./. ''/'
What/W 's/V more/J ,/, he/P thinks/V this/D could/M be/V a/D nastier/J recession/N than/I usual/J :/: ``/` Once/R the/D downturn/N comes/V ,/, it/P 's/V going/V to/T be/V very/R hard/J to/T reverse/V ./. ''/'
Investors/N ,/, he/P advises/V ,/, ``/` should/M be/V cautious/J ,/, ''/' holding/V fewer/J stocks/N than/I usual/J and/C also/R shunning/V bonds/N ./.
Because/I he/P sees/V ``/` 5/C %/N to/T 6/C %/N base/N rate/N of/I inflation/N in/I the/D economy/N ,/, ''/' he/P doubts/V that/I interest/N rates/N will/M fall/V much/R any/D time/N soon/R ./.
Instead/R ,/, Mr./N Beach/N says/V ,/, investors/N ``/` probably/R should/M be/V carrying/V a/D very/R high/J level/N of/I cash/N ,/, ''/' by/I which/W he/P means/V such/J so-called/J cash/N equivalents/N as/I money-market/J funds/N and/C Treasury/N bills/N ./.
Greg/N Confair/N ,/, president/N of/I Sigma/N Financial/N Inc./N in/I Allentown/N ,/, Pa./N ,/, also/R recommends/V that/I investors/N go/V heavily/R for/I cash/N ./.
He/P is/V n't/R sure/R a/D recession/N is/V coming/V ,/, but/C says/V the/D other/J likely/J alternative/N --/: reignited/V inflation/N --/: is/V just/R as/R bad/J ./.
``/` This/D late/J in/I an/D expansion/N ,/, ''/' the/D economy/N tends/V to/T veer/V off/R either/C into/I damaging/J inflation/N or/C into/I a/D recession/N ,/, Mr./N Confair/N says/V ./.
The/D Federal/N Reserve/N Board/N 's/P plan/N for/I a/D ``/` soft/J landing/N ,/, ''/' he/P says/V ,/, requires/V the/D Fed/N to/T navigate/V ``/` an/D ever-narrowing/J corridor/N ./. ''/'
A/D soft/J landing/N is/V n't/R something/N that/W can/M be/V achieved/V once/R and/C for/I all/D ,/, Mr./N Confair/N adds/V ./.
It/P has/V to/T be/V engineered/V over/R and/C over/R again/R ,/, month/N after/I month/N ./.
He/P believes/V that/I the/D task/N facing/V Fed/N Chairman/N Alan/N Greenspan/N is/V so/R difficult/J that/I it/P resembles/V ``/` juggling/N a/D double-bladed/J ax/N and/C a/D buzz/N saw/N ./. ''/'
And/C ,/, in/I a/D sense/N ,/, that/D 's/V the/D kind/N of/I task/N individuals/N face/V in/I deciding/V what/W to/T do/V about/I stocks/N --/: the/D mainstay/N of/I most/J serious/J investors/N '/P portfolios/N ./.
It/P comes/V down/R to/T a/D question/N of/I whether/I to/T try/V to/T ``/` time/V ''/' the/D market/N ./.
For/I people/N who/W can/M ride/V out/R market/N waves/N through/I good/J times/N and/C bad/J ,/, stocks/N have/V been/V rewarding/J long-term/J investments/N ./.
Most/J studies/N show/V that/I buy-and-hold/C investors/N historically/R have/V earned/V an/D annual/J return/N from/I stocks/N of/I 9/C %/N to/T 10/C %/N ,/, including/V both/D dividends/N and/C price/N appreciation/N ./.
That/D 's/V well/R above/I what/W bonds/N or/C bank/N certificates/N have/V paid/V ./.
Moreover/R ,/, because/I no/D one/P knows/V for/I sure/J just/R when/W a/D recession/N is/V coming/V ,/, some/D analysts/N think/V investors/N should/M n't/R even/R worry/V too/R much/R about/I timing/N ./.
``/` Trying/V to/T time/N the/D economy/N is/V a/D mistake/N ,/, ''/' says/V David/N Katz/N ,/, chief/J investment/N officer/N of/I Value/N Matrix/N Management/N Inc./N in/I New/N York/N ./.
Mr./N Katz/N notes/V that/I some/D economists/N have/V been/V predicting/V a/D recession/N for/I at/I least/J two/C years/N ./.
Investors/N who/W listened/V ,/, and/C lightened/V up/R on/I stocks/N ,/, ``/` have/V just/R hurt/V themselves/P ,/, ''/' he/P says/V ./.
Mr./N Katz/N adds/V that/I people/N who/W jump/V in/I and/C out/I of/I the/D stock/N market/N need/V to/T be/V right/J about/R 70/C %/N of/I the/D time/N to/T beat/V a/D buy-and-hold/J strategy/N ./.
Frequent/J trading/N runs/N up/I high/J commission/N costs/N ./.
And/C the/D in-and-outer/N might/M miss/V the/D sudden/J spurts/N that/W account/V for/I much/J of/I the/D stock/N market/N 's/P gains/N over/I time/N ./.
Still/R ,/, few/J investors/N are/V able/J to/T sit/V tight/R when/W they/P are/V convinced/V a/D recession/N is/V coming/V ./.
After/I all/D ,/, in/I all/D five/C recessions/N since/I 1960/C ,/, stocks/N declined/V ./.
According/V to/T Ned/N Davis/N ,/, president/N of/I Ned/N Davis/N Research/N Inc./N in/I Nokomis/N ,/, Fla./N ,/, the/D average/J drop/N in/I the/D Dow/N Jones/N Industrial/N Average/N was/V about/R 21/C %/N ,/, and/C the/D decrease/N began/V an/D average/N of/I six/C months/N before/I a/D recession/N officially/R started/V ./.
By/I the/D time/N a/D recession/N is/V ``/` official/J ''/' -LRB-/- two/C consecutive/J quarters/N of/I declining/V gross/J national/J product/N -RRB-/- ,/, much/J of/I the/D damage/N to/T stocks/N has/V already/R been/V done-and/C ,/, in/I the/D typical/J case/N ,/, the/D recession/N is/V already/R half/R over/J ./.
About/R six/C months/N before/I a/D recession/N ends/V ,/, stocks/N typically/R begin/V to/T rise/V again/R ,/, as/I investors/N anticipate/V a/D recovery/N ./.
The/D average/J recession/N lasts/V about/R a/D year/N ./.
Unfortunately/R ,/, though/R ,/, recessions/N vary/V enough/R in/I length/N so/R that/I the/D average/N ca/M n't/R reliably/R be/V used/V to/T guide/V investors/N in/I timing/V stock/N sales/N or/C purchases/N ./.
But/C whatever/W their/P advice/N about/I timing/N ,/, none/N of/I these/D experts/N recommend/V jettisoning/V stocks/N entirely/R during/I a/D recession/N ./.
For/I the/D portion/N of/I an/D investor/N 's/P portfolio/N that/W stays/V in/I stocks/N ,/, professionals/N have/V a/D number/N of/I suggestions/N ./.
Mr./N Katz/N advocates/V issues/N with/I low/J price-earnings/J ratios/N --/: that/D is/V ,/, low/J prices/N in/I relation/N to/T the/D company/N 's/P earnings/N per/I share/N ./.
``/` Low/N P-E/N ''/' stocks/N ,/, he/P says/V ,/, vastly/R outperform/V others/N ``/` during/I a/D recession/N or/C bear/N market/N ./. ''/'
In/I good/J times/N ,/, he/P says/V ,/, they/P lag/V a/D bit/N ,/, but/C overall/R they/P provide/V superior/J performance/N ./.
Prof./N Arbel/N urges/V investors/N to/T discard/V stocks/N in/I small/J companies/N ./.
Small-company/J shares/N typically/R fall/V more/R than/I big-company/J stocks/N in/I a/D recession/N ,/, he/P says/V ./.
And/C in/I any/D case/N ,/, he/P argues/V ,/, stocks/N of/I small/J companies/N are/V ``/` almost/R as/R overpriced/J as/I they/P were/V Sept./N 30/C ,/, 1987/C ,/, just/R before/I the/D crash/N ./. ''/'
For/I example/N ,/, Mr./N Arbel/N says/V ,/, stocks/N of/I small/J companies/N are/V selling/V for/I about/R 19/C times/N cash/N flow/N ./.
Cash/N flow/N ,/, basically/R earnings/N plus/I depreciation/N ,/, is/V one/C common/J gauge/N of/I a/D company/N 's/P financial/J health/N ./. -RRB-/-
That/I ratio/N is/V dangerously/R close/J to/T the/D ratio/N of/I 19.7/C that/W prevailed/V before/I the/D 1987/C stock-market/N crash/N ,/, Mr./N Arbel/N says/V ./.

Another/D major/J trick/N in/I making/V a/D portfolio/N recession-resistant/J is/V choosing/V stocks/N in/I ``/` defensive/J ''/' industries/N ./.
